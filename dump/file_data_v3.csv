Hi dears! This is TommyLeaks team and it is pleasure for us to inform you that your company network has been breached. We have stolen your files and documents and exfiltrated only the most sensitive and useful information from that.

First of all, remain calm and do not undertake any hasty actions at that moment if you want to save your reputation and avoid any bad scenarios:
- do not go to the authorities. They will perhaps confiscate your PCs and other IT equipment and will not prevent the process of your data leaking (hundred percent);
- do not contact any recovery agencies. They will just make money from your incident and of course try to cheat you. You will not save money at this case. It is better and cheaper for you to communicate with us on your own.

We're here not to rob you and won't be trying to intimidate you, we're just interested in helping you to rebuild your security infrastructure and be safe further. But of course our services cost money. How much? Will be known once we check your finance. We aren't going to ask for too much, so please do not try to bargain with us with no worthy arguments. Remember that all your files are in front of us.

As for the guarantees, we are committed to provide you with deletion log, breach report and other necessary materials once we receive the payment. We work for reputation and do not want some victim to spread any bad gossips about us or something, so be sure that the deal will be clean and honest. We guarantee that we will not attack your network again after payment but we will return in case deal falling through.

Once you are ready to move to the payment stage, there are some recommendations on how to do this securely:
- if you go to the bank to take a loan or just withdraw your funds, tell the bank that you need this money for the investment purposes only;
- if you have some troubles gaining bitcoins, just go to any exchange platform (coinbase.com, for instance) or a local broker to buy BTC from them for cash. That way no authorities or researchers do not trace your bank transfers. You may also go to the third party person who may make a transfer instead of you. 

So, that's it. And finally to contact us use this link - https://xir242nunyist4d7ksfnfmhnjx4gvqbuzo7eax4o3abqjesbxjshh4qd.onion/
You have to open the link only in TOR Browser (download it here: https://www.torproject.org). Then insert your password -  - inside the field on the page and we will be able to communicate securely.

Please do not waste time because now it plays againts you.

Your network is hacked and files are encrypted.
	Including the encrypted data we also downloaded other confidential information:
	Data of your employees, customers, partners, as well as accounting and
	other internal documentation of your company.

All data is stored until you will pay.
	After payment we will provide you the programs for decryption and we will delete your data.
	If you refuse to negotiate with us (for any reason) all your data will be put up for sale.

What you will face if your data gets on the black market:
	1) The personal information of your employees and customers may be used to obtain a loan or
		purchases in online stores.
	2) You may be sued by clients of your company for leaking information that was confidential.
	3) After other hackers obtain personal data about your employees, social engineering will be
		applied to your company and subsequent attacks will only intensify.
	4) Bank details and passports can be used to create bank accounts and online wallets through 
		which criminal money will be laundered.
	5) You will forever lose the reputation.
	6) You will be subject to huge fines from the government.
		You can learn more about liability for data loss here:
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation
			https://gdpr-info.eu/
	Courts, fines and the inability to use important files will lead you to huge losses.
	The consequences of this will be irreversible for you.
	Contacting the police will not save you from these consequences,
		but will only make your situation worse.

You can get out of this situation with minimal losses
	To do this you must strictly observe the following rules:
		DO NOT Modify, DO NOT rename, DO NOT copy, DO NOT move any files.
			Such actions may DAMAGE them and decryption will be impossible.
		DO NOT use any third party or public decryption software, it may also DAMAGE files.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/ransomware_notes_v2/hunters/READ ME NOW!.txt,"1. WHAT HAPPENED? <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Your company's network has been compromised by the HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL group.
All files are encrypted using a military-grade AES encryption algorithm.
A large amount of sensitive data was exfiltrated.
We usually download:
- Employees personal data: CVs, DL, SSN, PII, NDA contracts, etc.
- Financial information: documents, payrolls, bank statements, bills, transfers,
  budgets, annual reports, etc.
- Customer data: contracts, PII, contacts, purchase agreements, etc.
- Confidential: source code, trade secrets, technology, blueprints, documents, 
  etc.
- Work files, databases, legal documents, corporate correspondence.
- Accounting data.
- Audit reports.
2. WHAT DO WE OFFER <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
To prevent exfiltrated data from being disclosed and to decrypt all the files 
you need to make a payment. Contact us following the instructions:
1) Install and run “Tor Browser” from https://www.torproject.org/download/
2) Go to a dedicated website:
https://hunters33mmcwww7ek7q5ndahul6nmzmrsumfs6aenicbqon6mxfiqyd.onion/

3. WHAT IF NOT? <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
We have the most powerful data leak site on the Internet. There are a lot of 
journalists, researchers and other hackers.
https://hunters55rdxciehoqzwv7vgyv6nt37tbwax2reroyzxhou7my5ejyid.onion/
https://huntersinternational.net/ (mirror)
An incomplete list of risks you are facing in case of non-payment:
 - Loss of customer trust and loyalty.
 - Damage to the company's reputation.
 - Legal consequences and compliance fines.
 - Financial losses and costs associated with data recovery.
 - Impact on competitive advantage and market share.
 - Breach of data privacy regulations and laws.
 - Disruption of business operations.
 - Reduced employee morale and productivity.
 - Potential for intellectual property theft.
 - Loss of trade secrets and proprietary information.
4. KEEP IN MIND <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
- Do not try to decrypt using third-party software. You will damage the files.
- Do not report to the Police, FBI, etc. They don't care about your business.
  They simply won't allow you to pay. As a result, you will lose everything.
- Do not hire a recovery company. They can't decrypt without the key.
  They also don't care about your business. They believe that they are
  good negotiators, but it is not. They usually fail. So speak for yourself.
- Do not reject to pay. Exfiltrated files will be disclosed right away.",ransom

Our pentest services should be paid just like you pay the salaries of your system administrators. Get over it and pay for it.
If we don't give you a decryptor or delete your data after you pay, no one will pay us in the future.
You can get more information about us on Twitter https://twitter.com/hashtag/incransom?f=live

Download and install Tor Browser https://www.torproject.org/
Write to the chat room and wait for an answer, we'll guarantee a response from you.
Sometimes you will have to wait some time for our reply, this is because we have a lot of work and we attack tens of companies around the world.

-----> Warning! Don't delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to problems with decryption of files!
-----> Don't go to the police or the FBI for help. They won't help you.
The police will try to prohibit you from paying the ransom in any way.
The first thing they will tell you is that there's no guarantee to decrypt your files and remove stolen files.
This is not true, we can do a test decryption before paying and your data will be guaranteed to be removed because it's a matter of our reputation.
Paying the ransom to us is much cheaper and more profitable than paying fines and legal fees.
The police and the FBI don't care what losses you suffer as a result of our attack, and we'll help you get rid of all your problems for a modest sum of money.
If you're worried that someone will trace your bank transfers, you can easily buy cryptocurrency for cash, thus leaving no digital trail that someone from your company paid our ransom.
The police and FBI won't be able to stop lawsuits from your customers for leaking personal and private information.
The police and FBI won't protect you from repeated attacks. 

-----> Don't go to recovery companies!
They are essentially just middlemen who will make money off you and cheat you.
We are well aware of cases where recovery companies tell you that the ransom price is $5M dollars, but in fact they secretly negotiate with us for $1M.
If you approached us directly without intermediaries you would pay several times less.

-----> For those who have cyber insurance against ransomware attacks.
Insurance companies require you to keep your insurance information secret.
In most cases, we find this information and download it.

-----> If you do not pay the ransom, we will attack your company again in the future.

Good news:
- 100% of your Server system and Data will be restored by our Decryption Tool;
- for now, your data is secured and safely stored on our server;
- nobody in the world is aware about the data leak from your company except you and Abyss Locker team.

FAQs:

Want to go to authorities for protection?
- they will do their job properly, but you will not get any win points out of it, only headaches; they will never make decryption for data or servers, they just can’t. 
  Also, they will take all of your IT infrastructure as a part of their procedures… but still they will not help you at all. 

Think you can handle it without us by decrypting your servers and data using some IT Solution from third-party non-hackers’ “specialists”?
- they will only make significant damage to all of your data; every encrypted file will be corrupted forever. Only our Decryption Tool will make decryption 100% guaranteed;  

Think your partner IT Recovery Company will do files restoration? 
- no they will not do restoration, only take 3-4 weeks for nothing; besides all of your data is on our servers and we can publish it at any time; 
  as well as send the info about the data breach from your company servers to your key partners and clients, competitors, media and youtubers, etc. 
  Those actions from our side towards your company will have irreversible negative consequences for your business reputation.

You don’t care in any case, because you just don’t want to pay hackers? 
- We will make you business stop forever by using all of our experience to make your partners, clients, employees and whoever cooperates with your company change their minds by having no choice but to stay away from your company. 
  As a result, in midterm you will have to close your business. 

So lets get straight to the point.

What do we offer in exchange on your payment:
- decryption and restoration of all your systems and data within 24 hours with 100% guarantee;
- never inform anyone about the data breach out from your company;
- after data decryption and system restoration, we will delete all of your data from your servers forever;

Hello!

	If you are reading this, it means that your system were hit by Royal ransomware.
	Please contact us via :
	http://royal2xthig3ou5hd7zsliqagy6yygk2cdelaxtni2fyad6dpmpxedid.onion/

In the meantime, let us explain this case.It may seem complicated, but it is not!
Most likely what happened was that you decided to save some money on your security infrastructure.
Alas, as a result your critical data was not only encrypted but also copied from your systems on a secure server.
From there it can be published online.Then anyone on the internet from darknet criminals, ACLU journalists, Chinese government(different names for the same thing),
and even your employees will be able to see your internal documentation: personal data, HR reviews, internal lawsuitsand complains, financial reports, accounting, intellectual property, and more!

	Fortunately we got you covered!

Royal offers you a unique deal.For a modest royalty(got it; got it ? ) for our pentesting services we will not only provide you with an amazing risk mitigation service,
covering you from reputational, legal, financial, regulatory, and insurance risks, but will also provide you with a security review for your systems.
To put it simply, your files will be decrypted, your data restoredand kept confidential, and your systems will remain secure.

	Try Royal today and enter the new era of data security!
	We are looking to hearing from you soon!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] What happened?
Your computers and servers are encrypted, backups are deleted. We use strong encryption algorithms, so you cannot decrypt your data.Each system in the network is encrypted with a unique identifier.
But you can restore everything by purchasing a special program from us - universal decryptor. This program will restore all your network.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] What guarantees you have?
We are a non-politically motivated international group from anywhere in the world, we care about nothing but your money
You can send some encrypted files from your network and we will decrypt it for free.
We value our reputation. If we do not fulfill our work and obligations, no one will pay us. It's not in our interest.
All of our decryption software is perfectly tested and will decrypt your data. We will also provide support in case of problems.

[+] Attention!
Do not rename encrypted files.
Do not try to decrypt your data using third party software, it may cause permanent data loss.
Decryption of your files with the help of third parties may cause increased price (they add their fee to our) or you can become a victim of a scam.

     1. Download and install Telegram Messenger (https://telegram.org).
     2. Please contact with the ID https://t.me/NovaGroup2023 
     3. Or you can contact us via email at novagroup@onionmail.org
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+]Do you need forensics?
Note that we are a professional team with different nationalities
ransomware is a part of the world of cyber security, even big companies make payments, but no news is communicated to the outside world So we advise you not to talk to anyone about your business being hacked
All logs are completely removed So you don't even know how you got hacked But don't worry, we will also provide you with a complete security report
The virus has the ability to self-destruct, so reverse engineering is not possible
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] What will I get in case of agreement?
You WILL GET full DECRYPTION of your machines in the network
RECOMMENDATIONS for securing your network perimeter.
And the FULL CONFIDENTIALITY ABOUT INCIDENT.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] Warnings!
Do not go to recovery companies, they are just middlemen who will make money off you and cheat you.
They secretly negotiate with us, buy decryption software and will sell it to you many times more expensive or they will simply scam you.
In order to create a public decryption, the executable file of the virus needs to be available to reverse engineering experts, but since the program has the ability to self-destruct, so far no public file has been placed on the Internet So any claim of decryption by individuals is a scam
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] Very important! For those who have cyber insurance against ransomware attacks.
Insurance companies require you to keep your insurance information secret, this is to never pay the maximum amount specified in the contract or to pay nothing at all, disrupting negotiations.
The insurance company will try to derail negotiations in any way they can so that they can later argue that you will be denied coverage because your insurance does not cover the ransom amount.
For example your company is insured for 10 million dollars, while negotiating with your insurance agent about the ransom he will offer us the lowest possible amount, for example 100 thousand dollars, we will refuse the paltry amount and ask for example the amount of 15 million dollars, the insurance agent will never offer us the top threshold of your insurance of 10 million dollars.
He will do anything to derail negotiations and refuse to pay us out completely and leave you alone with your problem. If you told us anonymously that your company was insured for $10 million and other important details regarding insurance coverage

Our team has an extensive background in legal and so called white hat hacking.
However, clients usually considered the found vulnerabilities to be minor and poorlyr\n
paid for our services.
So we decided to change our business model. Now you understand how important it isr\n

to allocate a good budget for IT security.
This is serious business for us and we really don't want to ruin your privacy,r\n
reputation and a company.
We just want to get paid for our work whist finding vulnerabilities in various networks.

Your files are currently encrypted with our tailor made state of the art algorithm.
Don't try to terminate unknown processes, don't shutdown the servers, do not unplug drives,
all this can lead to partial or complete data loss.

We have also managed to download a large amount of various, crucial data from your network.
A complete list of files and samples will be provided upon request.

We can decrypt a couple of files for free. The size of each file must be no more than 5 megabytes.

All your data will be successfully decrypted immediately after your payment.
You will also receive a detailed list of vulnerabilities used to gain access to your network.
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

If you refuse to cooperate with us, it will lead to the following consequences for your company:
1. All data downloaded from your network will be published for free or even sold
2. Your system will be re-attacked continuously, now that we know all your weak spotsr

3. We will also attack your partners and suppliers using info obtained from your network
4. It can lead to legal actions against you for data breaches

We would like to inform that your network has been tested by us for vulnerabilities.

Poor network security could cause your data to be lost forever.

Your files are currently encrypted, they can be restored to their original state with a decryptor key that only we have.
The key is in a single copy on our server.

Attempting to recover data by your own efforts may result in data loss.
It is important not to change their current state. Each file additionally has a unique cipher, which you can restore only with our help.

We also examined your infrastructure and downloaded the most sensitive data.
The list of hosts from which the information was downloaded:

- 172.16.10.77 (.local)
- 172.16.10.51 (.LOCAL) 
- 172.16.10.75 (.local)
- 172.16.10.85 (.local)
- 172.16.10.87 (.local)
- 10.10.10.30 Synology (access via OpenVPN :1194)
----------------------------------
-email communications with clients that contain confidential agreements
-accounting and tax reports for each client
-audit documents
-companys and clients financial documents
-clients passports/ID's and private information
-documents contain privileged and confidential information
-password-protected documents from a bank
-payroll data
-company financial and performance data
-employees personal information (Tc Identification Numbers)


The total amount of downloaded information more than 200 Gb

If you do not contact us within 3 days, or we cannot reach an agreement, all data will be published 
on a site that no one can block. 

Confidential data can be helpful for your competitors, enemies and darknet market hackers from over the world. 
The consequences will be unpredictable and the process cannot be stopped. 
Information about data leaks is bound to get into the media. Your company's reputation will be damaged.

We value and respect every business, including yours.
Therefore, we suggest you avoid further negative consequences and return to your work as soon as possible.

We guarantee a fair and confidential deal in the shortest possible time. 
You will not only receive a decryptor, but also a description of your network vulnerabilities and information security recommendations. If necessary, you will be provided with qualified data recovery assistance. 

You can trust us! Reputation is important to everyone. 
As a proof of our statements, we are ready to restore some files for free and
demonstrate how our product works.

Best regards, Underground team !

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/ransomware_notes_v2/gwisinlocker/gwisinlocker.txt,"Hello ,
You have been visited by GWISIN.
We have exfiltrated a lot of sensitive data from your networks, including, but not limited to:

I. Production applications, source (Git/SVN), files and DBs
[1] LIMS (all regions) + DNA and other internal platforms

By combining lab (LIMS) data and the primary big customer platform (DNA), it is easy to identify customer projects, credentials and data.
Despite ISO27001 and ISMS-P with a good PIMS strategy, you have failed to protect customer data across all services.
Your privacy policy assures customers their data security and privacy is top priority, reality seems very different. 
We wonder what your customers will have to say about that?

[2] My-genomestory (MGS), myPETGENE and general DTC related data

Once again failing to protect very sensitive data and communications of your customers.

[3] Infrastructure and sequencing pipeline data / scripts 

Everything from documentation to project specs to produced VCFs and PDF reports post-analysis were collected. 
More importantly, a full deep dive of your network infrastructure documentation and access.
The only way to kick us out is to buy all new hardware, including network equipment (UTM / switches) and sequencing / data storage systems.  
Someone could have quietly modified your sequencing pipeline instead of contacting you, causing you much bigger issues (legal, financial and otherwise). 
Can you really trust your results, if you can't trust your input data and processing pipelines?

II. Internal Data & Communications

[1] ERP/CRM Systems (NEOE, Dynamics)
[2] Active Directory dump with credential history (NTDS + passive credential collection)
[3] DO GW with DB (your groupware contains a lot of data)
[4] Exchange email communications (PST) of targeted important employees in various roles
[5] Financial / Accounting / Research / IT / Customer / Etc. documents

- A lot of documents and other files were collected from SHARE/NEWSHARE machines among other servers
- Your DLP and monitoring was rendered effectively useless and could not stop us, neither could your security team and defensive products

We have also encrypted critical Windows and Linux servers.
We recommend that you do NOT restart servers or recovery may be slower.
The good news for you is that we can:
- Decrypt all files with extension "".[victim_snip]"" very quickly
- Delete all sensitive data we have exfiltrated, instead of selling it
- Help you improve your security
- Disappear and not be your problem anymore

All you have to do is follow the instructions:
1.) Download Tor Browser: https://www.torproject.org/download/
2.) Go to our website: http://:@gwisin4yznpdtzq424i3la6oqy5evublod4zbhddzuxcnr34kgfokwad.onion
3.) Login with username: , password: 
4.) Change password (one time setup)
5.) Setup end-to-end message encryption password
6.) Read the full instructions on the website and contact us using the message system provided there

[WARNING - #1] 
If you are having trouble reaching our website, attempt closing and re-opening the Tor browser. 
If you are still unable to reach our website, create a DNS TXT record @ [victim_subdomain].[victim_domain].com containing a hex-encoded email address and we will contact you.
However, eventually we will need to communicate using our website to preserve the privacy of all parties involved. 

[WARNING - #2]
Do NOT contact law enforcement (such as NPA, KISA or SMPA) or threat intelligence organizations as they may prevent you from recovering quickly.
They can't really help you and they don't care if your business is destroyed in the process.
Contact us within 72 working hours, so we can negotiate in good faith and resolve this quickly.

If you don't pay the ransom, the data will be published on our TOR darknet sites.
The sooner you pay the ransom, the sooner your company will be safe.

-----> What guarantees are that we won't fool you?
We are not a politically motivated group and we want nothing more than money.
If you pay, we will provide you with decryption software and destroy the stolen data.
After you pay the ransom, you will quickly restore your systems and make even more money.
Treat this situation simply as a paid training for your system administrators, because it is due to your corporate network not being properly configured that we were able to attack you.
Our pentest services should be paid just like you pay the salaries of your system administrators. Get over it and pay for it.
If we don't give you a decryptor or delete your data after you pay, no one will pay us in the future.
You can get more information about us on Twitter https://twitter.com/hashtag/incransom?f=live

-----> You need to contact us on TOR darknet sites with your personal ID
Download and install Tor Browser https://www.torproject.org/
Write to the chat room and wait for an answer, we'll guarantee a response from you.
Sometimes you will have to wait some time for our reply, this is because we have a lot of work and we attack tens of companies around the world.

-----> Warning! Don't delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to problems with decryption of files!
-----> Don't go to the police or the FBI for help. They won't help you.
The police will try to prohibit you from paying the ransom in any way.
The first thing they will tell you is that there's no guarantee to decrypt your files and remove stolen files.
This is not true, we can do a test decryption before paying and your data will be guaranteed to be removed because it's a matter of our reputation.
Paying the ransom to us is much cheaper and more profitable than paying fines and legal fees.
The police and the FBI don't care what losses you suffer as a result of our attack, and we'll help you get rid of all your problems for a modest sum of money.
If you're worried that someone will trace your bank transfers, you can easily buy cryptocurrency for cash, thus leaving no digital trail that someone from your company paid our ransom.
The police and FBI won't be able to stop lawsuits from your customers for leaking personal and private information.
The police and FBI won't protect you from repeated attacks. 

-----> Don't go to recovery companies!
They are essentially just middlemen who will make money off you and cheat you.
We are well aware of cases where recovery companies tell you that the ransom price is $5M dollars, but in fact they secretly negotiate with us for $1M.
If you approached us directly without intermediaries you would pay several times less.

-----> For those who have cyber insurance against ransomware attacks.
Insurance companies require you to keep your insurance information secret.
In most cases, we find this information and download it.

They should pay for their lies and crimes, their names and shames. They should pay for occupation, war crimes against humanity,
killing the people (not only Palestinians’ bodies, but also Israelis’ souls) and destroying the future and all dreams we had.
They should pay for firing high-skilled experts.

Our instruction for the administration:
All your files are encrypted using AES-256 military grade algorithm. So,
	1. Don't try to recover data, because the encrypted files are unrecoverable unless you have the key.
	Any try for recovering data without the key (using third-party applications/companies) causes PERMANENT damage. Take it serious.
	2. You have to trust us. This is our business (after firing from high-tech companies) and the reputation is all we have.
	3. All you need to do is following up the payment procedure and then you will receive decrypting key using for returning all of your files and VMs.

3. You need cipher key / our decrypt software to restore you files. 
4. The police or authorities will not be able to help you get the cipher key. We encourage you to consider your decisions.


Contacting us will be the fastest and safest solution to the problem.

      - critical data was leaked, 
      - files are encrypted

                                  1. THE FOLLOWING IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN


1.1 EDITING FILES ON HDD. 	
                            Renaming, copying or moving any files 
                            could DAMAGE the cipher and 
                            decryption will be impossible. 

1.2 USING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE. 
                            Trying to recover with any software 
                            can also break the cipher and 
                            file recovery will become a problem.

1.3 SHUTDOWN OR RESTART THE PC. 
                            Boot and recovery errors can also damage the cipher. 
                            Sorry about that, but doing so is entirely at your own risk.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            
                                  2. EXPLANATION OF THE SITUATION
2.1 HOW DID THIS HAPPEN

The security of your IT perimeter has been compromised (it's not perfect at all). 
We encrypted your workstations and servers to make the fact of the intrusion visible and to prevent you from hiding critical data leaks.
We spent a lot of time researching and finding out the most important directories of your business, your weak points. 
We have already downloaded a huge amount of critical data and analyzed it. Now its fate is up to you, it will either be deleted or sold, or shared with the media.

2.2 VALUABLE DATA WE USUALLY STEAL:
                            - Databases, legal documents, personal information.
                            - Audit reports.
                            - Audit SQL database
                            - Any financial documents (Statements, invoices, accounting, transfers etc.).
                            - Work files and corporate correspondence.
                            - Any backups.
			    - Confidential documents.
2.3 TO DO LIST (best practies)
                            - Contact us as soon as possible.
                            - Contact us only in our live chat, otherwise you can run into scammers.
                            - Purchase our decryption tool and decrypt your files. There is no other way to do this.
                            - Realize that dealing with us is the shortest way to success and secrecy.
                            - Give up the idea of using decryption help programs, otherwise you will destroy the system permanently.
                            - Avoid any third-party negotiators and recovery groups. They can become the source of leaks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  3. POSSIBLE DECISIONS
3.1 NOT MAKING THE DEAL
                            - After 4 days starting tomorrow your leaked data will be Disclosed or sold.
                            - We will also send the data to all interested supervisory organizations and the media.
                            - Decryption key will be deleted permanently and recovery will be impossible.
                            - Losses from the situation can be measured based on your annual budget.

3.2 MAKING THE WIN-WIN DEAL
                            - You will get the only working Decryption Tool and the how-to-use Manual. 
                            - You will get our guarantees (with log provided) of non-recovarable deletion of all your leaked data.
                            - You will get our guarantees of secrecy and removal of all traces related to the deal in the Internet. 
                            - You will get our security report on how to fix your security breaches.

		purchases in online stores.
	2) You may be sued by clients of your company for leaking information that was confidential.
	3) After other hackers obtain personal data about your employees, social engineering will be
		applied to your company and subsequent attacks will only intensify.
	4) Bank details and passports can be used to create bank accounts and online wallets through 
		which criminal money will be laundered.
	5) You will forever lose the reputation.

Hello. ""3 am"" The time of mysticism, isn't it?

All your files are mysteriously encrypted, and the systems ""show no signs of life"", the backups disappeared. But we can correct this very quickly and return all your files and operation of the systems to original state.

All your attempts to restore data by himself will definitely lead to their damage and the impossibility of recovery. We are not recommended to you to do it on our own!!! (or do at your own peril and risk).


There is another important point: we stole a fairly large amount of sensitive data from your local network: financial documents; personal information of your employees, customers, partners; work documentation, postal correspondence and much more.

We prefer to keep it secret, we have no goal to destroy your business. Therefore can be no leakage on our part.

We propose to reach an agreement and conclude a deal.


Otherwise, your data will be sold to darknet. One can only guess how they will be used.

Please contact us as soon as possible, using Tor-browser:

So what happened?

All files are encrypted with Integrated Encryption Scheme.
The file structure was not damaged. You have been assigned a unique identifier.
After infection, you have 96 hours to declare decryption.

After the expiration of 96 hours, decryption cost will be automatically increased.
Now you should send us message with your personal ID, which is at the bottom of the message.
We hope that you understand the importance of the work we have done.

Before paying you can send us 2 files for free decryption.
The total size of files must be less than 2Mb.
Files should not contain valuable information (databases, backups, large excel sheets, etc..).

Attention! If you want to RECOVER YOUR DATA without problems - NEVER!!! :
reboot, disconnect hard drives or take any action unless you know WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!
Otherwise, we cannot be 100% sure that the decryptor will work correctly.

!!!THIS IS ESPECIALLY RELATED TO ESXI!!!

If you will try to use any third party software for restoring your data or antivirus solutions:
this can lead to complete damage to all files and their irrecoverable loss.
Any changes in encrypted files may entail damage of the private key and the loss of all data.

Your personal id: 
Username and password are identical to above.

Since we are using SSL encryption as well as .onion, the certificate is not properly signed.
So in order to get into the chat, you need to confirm the insecure connection exception.
Or just use our embeded APP (Windows version only for now). Thank you for understanding.

In addition to encrypting all your systems, deleting backups, we also downloaded 2 terabytes of confidential information.

Here's what you shouldn't do:

1) Contact the police, fbi or other authorities before the end of our deal

2) Contact the recovery company so that they would conduct dialogues with us. (This can slow down the recovery, and generally put our communication to naught)

3) Do not try to decrypt the files yourself, as well as do not change the file extension yourself !!! This can lead to the impossibility of their decryption.

4) Keep us for fools)

We will also stop any communication with you, and continue DDoS, calls to employees and business partners. 

In a few weeks, we will simply repeat our attack and delete all your data from your networks, WHICH WILL LEAD TO THEIR UNAVAILABILITY!

Here's what you should do right after reading it:

1) If you are an ordinary employee, send our message to the CEO of the company, as well as to the IT department

2) If you are a CEO, or a specialist in the IT department, or another person who has weight in the company, you should contact us within 24 hours by email.

We are ready to confirm all our intentions regarding DDOS, calls, and deletion of the date at your first request.

As a guarantee that we can decrypt the files, we suggest that you send several files for free decryption.

      - critical data was leaked,

--------------------------------------------------------
                                  1. THE FOLLOWING IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN

1.1 EDITING FILES ON HDD. 	
                            Renaming, copying or moving any files 
                            could DAMAGE the cipher and 
                            decryption will be impossible. 
1.2 USING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE. 
                            Trying to recover with any software 
                            can also break the cipher and 
                            file recovery will become a problem.
1.3 SHUTDOWN OR RESTART THE PC. 
                            Boot and recovery errors can also damage the cipher. 
                            Sorry about that, but doing so is entirely at your own risk.
--------------------------------------------------------
                                  2. EXPLANATION OF THE SITUATION
2.1 HOW DID THIS HAPPEN
The security of your IT perimeter has been compromised (it's not perfect at all). 
We encrypted your workstations and servers to make the fact of the intrusion visible and to prevent you from hiding critical data leaks.
We spent a lot of time researching and finding out the most important directories of your business, your weak points. 
We have already downloaded a huge amount of critical data and analyzed it. Now its fate is up to you, it will either be deleted or sold, or shared with the media.
2.2 VALUABLE DATA WE USUALLY STEAL:
                            - Databases, legal documents, personal information.
                            - Audit reports.
                            - Any financial documents (Statements, invoices, accounting, transfers etc.).
                            - Work files and corporate correspondence.
                            - Any backups.
			    - Confidential documents.
2.3 TO DO LIST (best practies)
                            - Contact us as soon as possible.
                            - Contact us only in our live chat, otherwise you can run into scammers.
                            - Purchase our decryption tool and decrypt your files. There is no other way to do this.
                            - Realize that dealing with us is the shortest way to success and secrecy.
                            - Give up the idea of using decryption help programs, otherwise you will destroy the system permanently.
                            - Avoid any third-party negotiators and recovery groups. They can become the source of leaks.
--------------------------------------------------------
                                  3. POSSIBLE DECISIONS
3.1 NOT MAKING THE DEAL
                            - After 6 days starting tomorrow your leaked data will be Disclosed or sold.
                            - We will also send the data to all interested supervisory organizations and the media.
                            - Decryption key will be deleted permanently and recovery will be impossible.
                            - Losses from the situation can be measured based on your annual budget.
3.2 MAKING THE WIN-WIN DEAL
                            - You will get the only working Decryption Tool and the how-to-use Manual. 
                            - You will get our guarantees (with log provided) of non-recovarable deletion of all your leaked data.
                            - You will get our guarantees of secrecy and removal of all traces related to the deal in the Internet. 
                            - You will get our security report on how to fix your security breaches.

  Cannot you find the files you need?
  Is the content of the files that you looked for not readable?
  
  It is normal because the files' names, as well as the data in your files
  have been encrypted.
  
  Great!!!
  You have turned to be a part of a big community #CerberRansomware.
  
  
  #########################################################################
  
  
  !!!  If you are reading this message it means the software
  !!!  ""Cerber Ransomware"" has been removed from your computer.

  What is encryption?
  -------------------
  
  Encryption is a reversible modification of information for security
  reasons but providing full access to it for authorized users.
  
  To become an authorized user and keep the modification absolutely
  reversible (in other words to have a possibility to decrypt your files)
  you should have an individual private key.
  
  But not only it.
  
  It is required also to have the special decryption software
  (in your case ""Cerber Decryptor"" software) for safe and complete
  decryption of all your files and data.
  
  
  #########################################################################
  
  
  Everything is clear for me but what should I do?
  ------------------------------------------------
  
  The first step is reading these instructions to the end.
  
  Your files have been encrypted with the ""Cerber Ransomware"" software; the
  instructions (""# DECRYPT MY FILES #.html"" and ""# DECRYPT MY FILES #.txt"")
  in the folders with your encrypted files are not viruses, they will
  help you.
  
  After reading this text the most part of people start searching in the
  Internet the words the ""Cerber Ransomware"" where they find a lot of
  ideas, recommendations and instructions.
  
  It is necessary to realize that we are the ones who closed the lock on
  your files and we are the only ones who have this secret key to
  open them.
  
  !!!  Any attempts to get back your files with the third-party tools can
  !!!  be fatal for your encrypted files.
  
  The most part of the third-party software change data within the
  encrypted file to restore it but this causes damage to the files.
  
  Finally it will be impossible to decrypt your files.
  
  When you make a puzzle but some items are lost, broken or not put in its
  place - the puzzle items will never match, the same way the third-party
  software will ruin your files completely and irreversibly.
  
  You should realize that any intervention of the third-party software to
  restore files encrypted with the ""Cerber Ransomware"" software may be
  fatal for your files.
  
  
  #########################################################################
  
  
  !!!  There are several plain steps to restore your files but if you do
  !!!  not follow them we will not be able to help you, and we will not try
  !!!  since you have read this warning already.
  
  
  #########################################################################
  
  
  For your information the software to decrypt your files (as well as the
  private key provided together) are paid products.
  
  After purchase of the software package you will be able to:
  
  1.  decrypt all your files;
  
  2.  work with your documents;
  
  3.  view your photos and other media;

>>>>> What guarantee is there that we won't cheat you? 

We are the oldest ransomware affiliate program on the planet, nothing is more important than our reputation. We are not a politically motivated group and we want nothing more than money. If you pay, we will provide you with decryption software and destroy the stolen data. After you pay the ransom, you will quickly make even more money. Treat this situation simply as a paid training for your system administrators, because it is due to your corporate network not being properly configured that we were able to attack you. Our pentest services should be paid just like you pay the salaries of your system administrators. Get over it and pay for it. If we don't give you a decryptor or delete your data after you pay, no one will pay us in the future. You can get more information about us on Ilon Musk's Twitter https://twitter.com/hashtag/lockbit?f=live

>>>>> Warning! Do not delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to problems with decryption of files!



>>>>> Don't go to the police or the FBI for help and don't tell anyone that we attacked you. 

They won't help and will only make things worse for you. In 3 years not a single member of our group has been caught by the police, we are top notch hackers and we never leave a trail of crime. The police will try to prohibit you from paying the ransom in any way. The first thing they will tell you is that there is no guarantee to decrypt your files and remove stolen files, this is not true, we can do a test decryption before paying and your data will be guaranteed to be removed because it is a matter of our reputation, we make hundreds of millions of dollars and are not going to lose our revenue because of your files. It is very beneficial for the police and FBI to let everyone on the planet know about your data leak because then your state will get the fines budgeted for you due to GDPR and other similar laws. The fines will be used to fund the police and the FBI, they will eat more sweet coffee donuts and get fatter and fatter. The police and the FBI don't care what losses you suffer as a result of our attack, and we will help you get rid of all your problems for a modest sum of money. Along with this you should know that it is not necessarily your company that has to pay the ransom and not necessarily from your bank account, it can be done by an unidentified person, such as any philanthropist who loves your company, for example, Elon Musk, so the police will not do anything to you if someone pays the ransom for you. If you're worried that someone will trace your bank transfers, you can easily buy cryptocurrency for cash, thus leaving no digital trail that someone from your company paid our ransom. The police and FBI will not be able to stop lawsuits from your customers for leaking personal and private information. The police and FBI will not protect you from repeated attacks. Paying the ransom to us is much cheaper and more profitable than paying fines and legal fees.



>>>>> What are the dangers of leaking your company's data.

First of all, you will receive fines from the government such as the GDRP and many others, you can be sued by customers of your firm for leaking information that was confidential. Your leaked data will be used by all the hackers on the planet for various unpleasant things. For example, social engineering, your employees' personal data can be used to re-infiltrate your company. Bank details and passports can be used to create bank accounts and online wallets through which criminal money will be laundered. On another vacation trip, you will have to explain to the FBI where you got millions of dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency transferred through your accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges. Your personal information could be used to make loans or buy appliances. You would later have to prove in court that it wasn't you who took out the loan and pay off someone else's loan. Your competitors may use the stolen information to steal technology or to improve their processes, your working methods, suppliers, investors, sponsors, employees, it will all be in the public domain. You won't be happy if your competitors lure your employees to other firms offering better wages, will you? Your competitors will use your information against you. For example, look for tax violations in the financial documents or any other violations, so you have to close your firm. According to statistics, two thirds of small and medium-sized companies close within half a year after a data breach. You will have to find and fix the vulnerabilities in your network, work with the customers affected by data leaks. All of these are very costly procedures that can exceed the cost of a ransomware buyout by a factor of hundreds. It's much easier, cheaper and faster to pay us the ransom. Well and most importantly, you will suffer a reputational loss, you have been building your company for many years, and now your reputation will be destroyed.

>>>>> Don't go to recovery companies, they are essentially just middlemen who will make money off you and cheat you. 

We are well aware of cases where recovery companies tell you that the ransom price is 5 million dollars, but in fact they secretly negotiate with us for 1 million dollars, so they earn 4 million dollars from you. If you approached us directly without intermediaries you would pay 5 times less, that is 1 million dollars.



>>>> Very important! For those who have cyber insurance against ransomware attacks.

Insurance companies require you to keep your insurance information secret, this is to never pay the maximum amount specified in the contract or to pay nothing at all, disrupting negotiations. The insurance company will try to derail negotiations in any way they can so that they can later argue that you will be denied coverage because your insurance does not cover the ransom amount. For example your company is insured for 10 million dollars, while negotiating with your insurance agent about the ransom he will offer us the lowest possible amount, for example 100 thousand dollars, we will refuse the paltry amount and ask for example the amount of 15 million dollars, the insurance agent will never offer us the top threshold of your insurance of 10 million dollars. He will do anything to derail negotiations and refuse to pay us out completely and leave you alone with your problem. If you told us anonymously that your company was insured for $10 million and other important details regarding insurance coverage, we would not demand more than $10 million in correspondence with the insurance agent. That way you would have avoided a leak and decrypted your information. But since the sneaky insurance agent purposely negotiates so as not to pay for the insurance claim, only the insurance company wins in this situation. To avoid all this and get the money on the insurance, be sure to inform us anonymously about the availability and terms of insurance coverage, it benefits both you and us, but it does not benefit the insurance company. Poor multimillionaire insurers will not starve and will not become poorer from the payment of the maximum amount specified in the contract, because everyone knows that the contract is more expensive than money, so let them fulfill the conditions prescribed in your insurance contract, thanks to our interaction.



>>>>> If you do not pay the ransom, we will attack your company again in the future.

1. Dealing with us you will save A LOT due to we are not interested in ruining your financially. We will study in depth your finance, bank & income statements, your savings, investments etc. and present our reasonable demand to you. If you have an active cyber insurance, let us know and we will guide you how to properly use it. Also, dragging out the negotiation process will lead to failing of a deal.

2. Paying us you save your TIME, MONEY, EFFORTS and be back on track within 24 hours approximately. Our decryptor works properly on any files or systems, so you will be able to check it by requesting a test decryption service from the beginning of our conversation. If you decide to recover on your own, keep in mind that you can permanently lose access to some files or accidently corrupt them - in this case we won't be able to help.

3. The security report or the exclusive first-hand information that you will receive upon reaching an agreement is of a great value, since NO full audit of your network will show you the vulnerabilities that we've managed to detect and used in order to get into, identify backup solutions and upload your data.

4. As for your data, if we fail to agree, we will try to sell personal information/trade secrets/databases/source codes - generally speaking, everything that has a value on the darkmarket - to multiple threat actors at ones. Then all of this will be published in our blog - https://akiral2iz6a7qgd3ayp3l6yub7xx2uep76idk3u2kollpj5z3z636bad.onion.

5. We're more than negotiable and will definitely find the way to settle this quickly and reach an agreement which will satisfy both of us.



If you're indeed interested in our assistance and the services we provide you can reach out to us following simple instructions:



1. Install TOR Browser to get access to our chat room - https://www.torproject.org/download/.

2. Paste this link - https://akiralkzxzq2dsrzsrvbr2xgbbu2wgsmxryd4csgfameg52n7efvr2id.onion.

3. Use this code -  - to log into our chat.



Keep in mind that the faster you will get in touch, the less damage we cause.

Although its not our intention if you do not cooperate we will not hesitate to make your data public including any confidential data sell to your competitors/bidders or send your clients their data just to make you look really bad and lose your clients trust or even worse being prosecuted for not telling your affected clients that their data has been compromised.

Talking to law enforcement will only ensure that you don't get a decryption key and put your business reputation on the line.

Follow the guidelines below to avoid losing your data:

* Do not rename encrypted files.
* Do not try to decrypt your data using third party software it may cause permanent data loss.
* Do not report to the Police, FBI, etc. They don't care about your business.
They simply won't allow you to pay. As a result you will lose everything.
* Do not hire a recovery company. They can't decrypt without the key.
They also don't care about your business. They believe that they are
good negotiators, but it is not. They usually fail. So speak for yourself.
* Do not reject to purchase. Exfiltrated files will be publicly disclosed.
