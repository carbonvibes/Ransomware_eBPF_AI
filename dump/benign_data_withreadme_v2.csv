The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining
correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why is
this?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?
Also, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of
only about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to
95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar
with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not
be understanding all of the differences.
In the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than
with glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the
intentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when
necessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It
is important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other
consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  The
first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, which
glasses couldn't help. 
would not help.

Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.

The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for ""a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters"". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer's fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.

""There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,"" said Shauna Perry, Bioware's audio and external resources producer. ""Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces."" She added: ""Not everyone is a model in the world so we don't want just models in our games."" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the person's head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. ""The 3D model will look exactly like the person - it's really quite incredible how detailed they are,"" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. ""We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. ""But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.""

British TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research.

New episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under, appear on the web hours after they are shown in the US, said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent, the firm said. ""It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR,"" said Ben Coppin from Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said the report, and an estimated 20,000 of those were from within the UK.

Fans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK. But in some cases, said the report, people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country. ""Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet,"" explained Mr Coppin.

""Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect, the internet is now a global video recorder."" Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode, others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term ""time-shifting"" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders, TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+, have also contributed to the trend. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.

Within half an hour, recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because they tend to be shorter then full-length films, they can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.

According to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year, which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. About six million people in the UK now have a fast, always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.

TV channel Five has been criticised for sending ""offensive"" and ""threatening"" advertising material to viewers for a new show about murder scene scientists.

Five mailed thousands of fake dossiers including photos of murder victims and an e-mail suggesting the recipient was being stalked by a serial killer. Following complaints, the Advertising Standards Authority contacted Five to cease promotion of crime show CSI:NY. Five admitted it had sent out 55,000 promotion packs but had now stopped. The promotion material was sent in brown envelope of the type used by investigators in the series, a spin-off from the highly successful CSI: Crime Scene Investigation series, which also runs on Five. The pack also features pictures of forensic evidence from a crime scene and a wanted poster, which did have a CSI:NY logo printed in large at the bottom.

Five said it had received 100 complaints but that it had been surprised at the reaction because it was ""obvious this material is promoting a drama"". A Five spokesman said: ""In light of the efforts we have made to make the nature of the contents so transparent we are surprised a very small minority of recipients have mistaken it as anything else. ""Everyone who was sent this promotion has expressed an interest in receiving details about this particular genre of programming on various websites. ""We have also received emails and calls from recipients praising the originality and imagination of the campaign.""

US supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart.

Winn-Dixie, once among the most profitable of US grocers, said Chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure. It said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. The Jacksonville, Florida-based firm has total debts of $1.87bn (Â£980m). In its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which it owes $15.1m.

Analysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers' demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. A 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie's slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. The company's new chief executive Peter Lynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around. ""This includes achieving significant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores,"" he said. Yet Evan Mann, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, said Mr Lynch's job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers. ""The real big issue is what's going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers,"" he said.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/technologie_9.txt,"Apple laptop is 'greatest gadget'

The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC.

The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first ""lightweight"" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs. The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. The magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a ""self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device"".

""In general we included only items that were potentially mobile,"" said the magazine.

""In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget,"" it concluded. The oldest ""gadget"" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place. Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia), as well as the first ""successful"" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac). The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13.

Sony's third entry in the top 20 is the CDP-101 CD player from 1983. ""Who can forget the crystalline, hiss-free blast of Madonna's Like A Virgin emenating from their first CD player?"" asked the magazine. Karl Elsener's knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list. Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th), 1980s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th).

Why worry about mobile phones. Soon they will be subsumed into the PDA's / laptops etc.

What about the Marine Chronometer? Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. For it's time, a technological marvel!

Sony Net Minidisc! It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. I always used my NetMD, and could not go anywhere without it.

A laptop computer is not a gadget! It's a working tool!

The Sinclair Executive was the world's first pocket calculator. I think this should be there as well.

How about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or a pocket calculator? All these things are useful to real people, not just PC magazine editors.

Are the people who created this list insane ? Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone? It has revolutionalised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.

Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker??

An interesting list. Of the electronic gadgets, thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100. The size of A4 paper and light, three weeks on a set of batteries, an excellent keyboard, a modem. A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible.

What's an Apple Powerbook 100 ? It's out of date - not much of a ""gadget"". Surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener, Swiss Army Knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves ?

It has to be the mobile phone. No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.

The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.

The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. A true gadget, it could be carried around and shown off.

All top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. I say this as the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20.

Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time. The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS. Shame the marketing was so bad!!!

Apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.

Utter rubbish. Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets. But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. No competition.

I'd also put Apple's Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason. I only wish that Vulcan Inc's Flipstart wasn't just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.

How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)? What about radios and TVs?

The swiss army knife. By far the most useful gadget. I got mine 12 years ago. Still wearing and using it a lot! It stood the test of time.

Psion Organiser series 3, should be up there. Had a usable qwerty keyboard, removable storage, good set of apps and programmable. Case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first, I think). Great product innovation.

The first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile PC?! Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site? It's obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.

The Motorola Startac should be Number One. Why? There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.

The Psion series 3c! The first most practical way to carry all your info around...

I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now.

I'd have put the mobile phone high up the list. Probably a Nokia model.

Sinclair Spectrum - 16k. It plugged into the tv. Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that's what I do for a living now.

I wish more modern notebooks -- even Apple's newest offerings -- were more like the PB100. Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball, which has given way to the largely useless ""trackpad"" which every notebook on the market today uses. They're invariably inaccurate, uncomfortable, and cumbersome to use.

Congratulations to Apple, a deserved win!

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/historical_7.txt,"After an asteroid crashed into what is now Chicxulub, Mexico 66 million years ago, a chain of events occurred that caused dinosaurs to disappear and mammals to flourish. But figuring out exactly what happened after this event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event, has been tricky due to a sparse fossil record. Yesterday (October 24), a team of researchers published a paper in Science detailing their 2016 discovery of a trove of plant and mammal fossils that sheds light on how ecosystems recovered after the asteroid impact.

The researchers, led by vertebrate paleontologist Tyler Lyson at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, have found over 1,000 vertebrate fossils, including 16 mammal species at the Corral Bluffs fossil site, located near Colorado Springs. They also found over 6,000 leaf fossils and 37,000 pollen grains, reports The New York Times.

“With this discovery, we’re starting to see the entire skull of many of these mammals that we previously only knew from teeth,” Stephen Chester, a mammalian paleontologist at Brooklyn College and paper coauthor, told the Times.

The site shows a near-continuous record of plant and animal life over a period of one million years following the K-Pg mass extinction, according to Science. Lyson and his team were able to determine the age of the site through volcanic ash layers with radioactive minerals, along with the presence of many fern fossils, which thrive after an ecosystem has been disturbed.

The researchers found that plants and animals rebounded faster than previously thought, and that when ferns were replaced by palm forests, the variety of plants also sparked diversification of mammals from small rat-sized animals to larger ones. By 700,000 years after the extinction event, some mammals were 100 times bigger than ones that had lived through the asteroid impact.

“This is one of those discoveries all paleontologists dream of,” Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the research, tells Science News.",benign

Details of the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console will be released in San Francisco on Monday.

Sony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, will unveil the chip at a technology conference. The chip is reported to be up to 10 times faster than current processors. It is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. Sony has said the Cell processor could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games. Special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in a video game, Sony told an audience at the E3 exhibition in Los Angeles last year.

Cell could also be marketed as an ideal technology for televisions and supercomputers, and everything in between, said Kevin Krewell, the editor in chief of Microprocessor Report. The chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch. Details of the chip will be released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. Some details have already emerged, however. When put inside powerful computer servers, the Cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations, or calculations, every second.

The chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. IBM said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the US. The first machines off the line using the Cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. A working version of the PS3 is due to be shown off in May 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. ""In the future, all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network,"" said Ken Kutaragi, chief operating officer of Sony, said last year.

Distinguished lawyer Lord Scarman, who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 Brixton riots, has died aged 93.

The peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career, serving as Law Commission chairman in its first seven years. He also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in Northern Ireland. Paying tribute, the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said Lord Scarman was one of the ""great advocates of our generation"".

""His legacy from his decisions in the Lords and the Court of Appeal is substantial. ""His work in the wake of the Brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none.

""A great judge, a great lawyer and a great man."" Lord Scarman's nephew George Ritchie said the peer, who passed away peacefully on Wednesday, would be ""sadly missed"".

The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, who is the most senior judge in England and Wales, said it was Lord Scarman's ""pioneering work"" which paved the way for the Human Rights Act 1998. ""He was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature, and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society,"" he said. ""He was, personally, totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him.""

Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the president of the Family Justice Division, said Lord Scarman was a ""good and humane judge"" and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century. Lord Scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in Brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. During the following three days of disturbances that spread to the Midlands, Merseyside, Bristol and Leeds, nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.

The inquiry famously settled on the so-called ""rotten apples"" theory, which argued that only a few police officers were racist, saying most were not. It spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the Police Complaints Authority. Trevor Phillips, chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, praised Lord Scarman's ""ability to listen"". He said: ""When Lord Scarman toured the streets of Brixton his presence was electrifying. ""A community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the English establishment. ""His great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds, many of whose language he could barely understand, genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings. ""He never lost the special combination of wisdom, humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the Brixton riots.""

Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 
 inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal
 bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is
 attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the
 enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.
 This will eventually cause death.
Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and
 approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients
 administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable
 improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured
 by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000
 per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called ""the most
 expensive disease in the world"".
I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying
 on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:
**news, stories, reports
**people you know with this disease
**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of
   enough money to buy some, programs available to help with

Japanese industry is growing faster than expected, boosting hopes that the country's retreat back into recession is over.

Industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in January from a month earlier. At the same time, retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month high, as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from April 2004 on. The Nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11,740.60 points, with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japan's economy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP. Only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. The output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials. ""Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession,"" said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui, despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.

Within the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. Among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars, chemicals and electronic goods. With US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. Electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market, with products such as flat-screen TVs in high demand during January.

MTV has been criticised for ""incessant sleaze"" by television indecency campaigners in the US.

The Parents Television Council (PTC), which monitors violence and sex on TV, said the cable music channel offered the ""cheapest form"" of programming. The group is at the forefront of a vociferous campaign to clean up American television. But a spokeswoman for MTV said it was ""unfair and inaccurate"" to single out MTV for criticism.

The PTC monitored MTV's output for 171 hours from 20 March to 27 March 2004, during the channel's Spring Break coverage. In its report - MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs and Alcohol - the PTC said it witnessed 3,056 flashes of nudity or sexual situations and 2,881 verbal references to sex. Brent Bozell, PTC president and conservative activist said: ""MTV is blatantly selling raunchy sex to kids. ""Compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults, MTV's programming contains substantially more sex, foul language and violence - and MTV's shows are aimed at children as young as 12. ""There's no question that TV influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers, and MTV is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent children.""

The watchdog decided to look at MTV's programmes after Janet Jackson's infamous ""wardrobe malfunction"" at last year's Super Bowl. The breast-baring incident generated 500,000 complaints and CBS - which is owned by the same parent company as MTV - was quick to apologise. MTV spokeswoman Jeannie Kedas said the network follows the same standards as broadcasters and reflects the culture and what its viewers are interested in. ""It's unfair and inaccurate to paint MTV with that brush of irresponsibility,"" she said. ""We think it's underestimating young people's intellect and level of sophistication."" Ms Kedas also highlighted the fact MTV won an award in 2004 for the Fight for Your Rights series that focused on issues such as sexual health and tolerance.

A majority of voters (68%) believe the prime minister has been damaged by the row over David Blunkett's involvement in a visa application, a poll suggests.

But nearly half those surveyed said Mr Blunkett should return to Cabinet if Labour won the next election. Some 63% of respondents in the Sunday Times poll thought his former lover - Kimberly Quinn - acted vindictively and 61% that he had been right to resign. YouGov polled a weighted sample of 1,981 voters online on 16-18 December. Mr Blunkett resigned as Home Secretary on Wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an e-mail showing a visa application by Mrs Quinn's former nanny had been speeded up. Sir Alan Budd's inquiry also found Mr Blunkett's account of events had been wrong. Almost a quarter (21%) of those polled for the Sunday Times said he should return to the Cabinet straight after the election. One in four said he should be back in the Government's top ranks within a year or two while 39% opposed a comeback.

Three-quarters said Mr Blunkett was right to go to court for the right to see Mrs Quinn's son - whom he says he fathered - and just 14% voiced sympathy for Mrs Quinn. A total of 53% of those polled said they had sympathy for Mr Blunkett, with 40% saying they did not. Forty-three per cent thought Mr Blunkett had done a good job as home secretary and 17% disagreed. Meantime, 32% said Mr Blair was a good prime minister and 38% disagreed. A majority, 52%, said Chancellor Gordon Brown had done a good job and just 16% disagreed.

A second poll for the Independent on Sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the Blunkett controversy. Labour lead the Conservatives by 39% to 34% with the Liberal Democrats on 19%. CommunicateResearch interviewed 401 people before David Blunkett's resignation and 601 afterwards. Some 82% said Mr Blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his, but 42% backed his legal action compared to 45% who thought it was unbecoming. Thirty per cent said the affair showed Mr Blunkett could not be trusted as a minister while 63%, disagreed.

Tony Blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries' debt and double aid.

Some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels, Oxfam says in a report, Paying the Price. The call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the G8 of top industrialised nations. ""As rich countries get richer, they're giving less and less. This scandal must stop,"" Oxfam's Barbara Stocking said.

""The world's poorest children are paying for rich countries' policies in aid and debt with their lives. ""2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure,"" the charity's director added. The report said: ""For rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity."" It also points out that in 1970 the G8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. But 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable, the report says.

It argues that the price of not investing in poor countries' sustainable development will be felt across the world. The report said: ""Global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security. ""Environmental crises and natural disasters, disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. Poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest. ""New threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities. ""Criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak.""

Both the prime minister and Chancellor Gordon Brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a ""scar"" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. Mr Brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to Britain by the world's poor nations. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said: ""The government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. ""If Britain's proposal for an International Finance Facility were adopted, the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier, by 2008-09. ""These additional resources will be used to increase UK bilateral aid to Africa to at least £1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least £1.5bn on HIV/Aids related work over the next three years.""

Many elementary school students in the United States are introduced to Native Americans in the context of the First Thanksgiving. They don’t reemerge until they become side notes in lesson plans on Manifest Destiny and the American West—a narrative that often ends at Wounded Knee in 1890. The term “The American-Indian Wars” groups multiple conflicts between diverse tribes and settlers spanning nearly three centuries of American History.

David Treuer, author of The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, writes, “Rather than a sidebar to American history proper, Native American history IS American history. You can't, for example, understand the American Revolution without considering that one of the main reasons for revolt against Britain was over the question of whether the colonists or their British masters got to reap the benefit of westward expansion; you can't understand the tension between states' rights and federal power unless you understand the removal of the 5 Civilized Tribes from the American Southeast in the 1820s and ‘30s and how that paved the way for the expansion of slavery…Native people have been, since the beginning, involved and implicated in the making of America.” ",benign

""But I take each race as it comes. ""As long as I keep up my training but not do too much I think there is a chance of a medal.""

For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form. In previous seasons, the 25-year-old also contested the long jump but since moving from Colchester to London she has re-focused her attentions.

After the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, in which the British mounted a surprise attack on German ships in the North Sea, the German navy chose not to confront Britain’s mighty Royal Navy in a major battle for more than a year, preferring to rest the bulk of its naval strategy on its U-boats.

The Korean War (1950-1953) was the first military action of the Cold War, though it’s often overshadowed by the victory of the Allies in World War II, earning it the nickname “the Forgotten War.” It began when soldiers from the communist North Korean People’s Army crossed the 38 parallel into the pro-Western Republic of Korea (today’s South Korea). American troops were sent to support the South and by the time a ceasefire was proclaimed in 1953, over five million soldiers and civilians had died. To this day, a formal peace treaty has not been signed.

The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt

don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.
A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  They'd need to go after

task quite significantly.
They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time
to get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars

prevented launches from it for a year or so.
There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  So

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/technologie_1.txt,"The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich has filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against Google, alleging that the company used “deceptive” practices to track the location of users even after they turned off location tracking.

Brnovich shared information about the lawsuit on his Twitter account. He accused Google of using “deceptive and unfair practices to obtain users’ location data”. This data is exploited for advertising, which accounts for more than 80 per cent of Google’s revenue.

Google collects detailed information about its users, including their physical locations, to target users for advertising. Often, this is done without the users’ consent or knowledge.

Brnovich wrote on Twitter: “Google collects detailed information about its users, including their physical locations, to target users for advertising. Often, this is done without the users’ consent or knowledge.”

He told the Washington Post that Google has been trying to find “misleading ways” to obtain information from users who try to opt out of data collection. He added that Google may be the “most innovative company in the world” but it is not above the law.

His office’s investigation of Google was initiated after reading a 2018 Associated Press report, which detailed how Google users are “lulled into a false sense of security” by privacy options, including the option to disable location history. The investigation found that many Google services on Android devices (and also iPhones) store location data even if the user selects privacy settings which purport to prevent Google from doing so.

The findings were confirmed by computer scientists at Princeton University.

The lawsuit specifically alleges that Google maintained location tracking for certain features, including weather and search engine queries, after the user disabled app-specific location tracking. Only when the user turns off broader system-level tracking did Google stop tracking location.

“We brought forward this action to put a stop to Google’s deceptive collection of user data, obtain monetary relief and require Google to disgorge gross receipts arising from its Arizona activities,” Brnovich added in another tweet.

He has asked for the courts to force Google to pay back any profits it may have earned by exploiting data fraudulently acquired from Arizonans. The Washington Post posits that Arizona’s state fraud laws may also allow for a $10,000 fine per violation.

Brnovich’s action comes on the heels of a lawsuit from New Mexico AG Hector Balderas, who sued Google for allegedly collecting children’s data without required parental consent - a possible violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 1998. According to the lawsuit, Google harvested data (including YouTube activity, voice recordings, physical locations, browser activity, and contacts) from free Chromebooks provided to schools through the G Suite for Education platform and then used this data for personalised advertising, up until April 2014. Balderas had previously sued Google and other companies for violating COPPA in 2018.

Although Google has made some compromises in recent years, such as making it easier to delete location data, it remains the target of lawmakers and activists for the aggressive data-harvesting practices on which its business model relies. Google and other US tech giants are facing a number of major regulatory and legal challenges around the world, mostly relating to antitrust and privacy.

Google said in a statement to media: “The [AG] and the contingency fee lawyers filing this lawsuit appear to have mischaracterised our services. We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We look forward to setting the record straight”",benign

However, there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of February's voting deadline. Mr Ballard said: ""This vote will set the future of transport in Edinburgh for decades to come. ""It is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in Edinburgh City and the surrounding areas, are registered to vote in the ballot. ""Many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say. ""Everyone involved in this debate - both for and against - wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible, and that means encouraging people to take part."" The ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council's proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it. The outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council. Towards the end of February, the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to Scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.

Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer.

He had to settle for bronze in Greece behind fellow American Justin Gatlin and Francis Obikwelu of Portugal. ""It really hurts to look at that medal. It was my mistake. I lost because of the things I did,"" said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday. ""It's never going to happen again. My goal - I'm going to win the worlds."" Greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind Gatlin, who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. ""In my semi-final race, I should have won the race but I was conserving energy. ""That's when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn't know he was there. ""I believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn't feel anything in the race.

""I just felt like I was running all alone. ""I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me."" Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg. The Kansas star is set to go head-to-head with Lewis-Francis again at Friday's Norwich Union Grand Prix. The pair contest the 60m, the distance over which Greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds. He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August. Greene believes Gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in Finland. But he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown. ""There's always someone else coming. I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd,"" Greene said. ""Now you've got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time.""

Rising fuel and materials costs are hitting confidence among the UK's small manufacturers despite a rise in output, business lobby group the CBI says.

A CBI quarterly survey found output had risen by the fastest rate in seven years but many firms were seeing the benefits offset by increasing expenses. The CBI also found spending on innovation, training and retraining is forecast to go up over the next year. However, firms continue to scale back investment in buildings and machinery.

The CBI said companies are looking to the government to lessen the regulatory load and are hoping interest rates will be kept on hold. ""Smaller manufacturers are facing an uphill struggle,"" said Hugh Morgan Williams, chair of the CBI's SME Council. ""The manufacturing sector needs a period of long-term stability in the economy."" The CBI found some firms managed to increase prices for the first time in nine years - but many said increases failed to keep up the rise in costs. Of the companies surveyed, 30% saw orders rise and 27% saw them fall. The positive balance of plus 3 compared with minus 10 in the previous survey. When firms were questioned on output volume, the survey returned a balance of plus 8 - the highest rate of increase for seven years - and rose to plus 11 when looking ahead to the next three months.

US rappers Beastie Boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song Pass the Mic.

The punk-rappers used three notes of music from flautist James Newton's Choir in their track from 1992. Although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, Mr Newton said his copyright had been infringed. But the US Court of Appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition. The Beastie Boys - Michael Diamond, Adam Horowitz, and Adam Yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music.

Sampling, now a standard practice among musicians, involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song. A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newton's recording. That finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the Beastie Boys. ""We hold that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newton's copyright,"" Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion. Mr Newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist, composer, performer, and university professor. Mr Newton and the Beastie Boys were not available for comment.

After years of wartime rationing, American consumers were ready to spend money—and factories made the switch from war to peace-time production.
In the summer of 1945, as World War II drew to a close, the U.S. economy was poised on the edge of an uncertain future.

Since President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s call in late 1940 for the United States to serve as the “arsenal of democracy,” American industry had stepped up to meet the challenge. U.S. factories built to mass-produce automobiles had retooled to churn out airplanes, engines, guns and other supplies at unprecedented rates. At the peak of its war effort, in late 1943 and early 1944, the United States was manufacturing almost as many munitions as all of its allies and enemies combined.

On the home front, the massive mobilization effort during World War II had put Americans back to work. Unemployment, which had reached 25 percent during the Great Depression and hovered at 14.6 percent in 1939, had dropped to 1.2 percent by 1944—still a record low in the nation’s history.",benign
/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/technologie_16.txt,"Global blogger action day called

The global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned Iranian bloggers.

The month-old Committee to Protect Bloggers' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 February to the ""Free Mojtaba and Arash Day"". Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran. Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. Iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. ""I hope this day will focus people,"" Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee, told the BBC News website.

The group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take, including writing to local Iranian embassies. The Committee has deemed Tuesday ""Free Mojtaba and Arash Day"" as part of its first campaign. It is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other ""cyber-dissidents"". ""If you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day',"" said Mr Hopkins. ""That would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. That alone will shine some light on the situation. ""If you don't have one, find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds."" Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to a US research think-tank.

The Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director. She has since started the International Bloggers' Bill of Rights, a global petition to protect bloggers at work. Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.

The Committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. ""Blogging is in this weird no man's land. People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view,"" said Mr Hopkins. ""Some think of themselves as pundits, kind of like journalists, and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. ""But they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.""

It is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.

""This is a big messy argument,"" explained Mr Hopkins. He added: ""It is just such a new way of doing business, there will be clamp downs."" But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said Mr Hopkins, ""is part of the whole messy conversation."" ""If you haven't already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. ""Everyone does this - mums, radicals, conservatives,"" he said. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. ""That is the essential difference. What I call 'templating software' gives every single person on Earth the chance to have one. ""You don't even have to have your own computer.""

The information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.

Richard Thomas ""totally condemned"" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served ""no current purpose"", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.

Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was ""too unlikely to have been a coincidence"", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or ""the destruction of important records"". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the ""e-mail regime"" could ""support the freedom of information regime"".

Mr Thomas said: ""The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence."" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.

""If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. ""But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned."" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.

Ms Hewitt said: ""We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. ""We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament."" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. ""We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400."" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: ""These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.""

She said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: ""While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected."" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.

Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be ""crippled"" by the move. ""While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,"" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/historical_16.txt,"World War I began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and lasted until 1918. During the conflict, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire (the Central Powers) fought against Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Romania, Japan and the United States (the Allied Powers). Thanks to new military technologies and the horrors of trench warfare, World War I saw unprecedented levels of carnage and destruction. By the time the war was over and the Allied Powers claimed victory, more than 16 million people—soldiers and civilians alike—were dead.

Archduke Franz Ferdinand
Tensions had been brewing throughout Europe—especially in the troubled Balkan region of southeast Europe—for years before World War I actually broke out.

A number of alliances involving European powers, the Ottoman Empire, Russia and other parties had existed for years, but political instability in the Balkans (particularly Bosnia, Serbia and Herzegovina) threatened to destroy these agreements.

The spark that ignited World War I was struck in Sarajevo, Bosnia, where Archduke Franz Ferdinand—heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire—was shot to death along with his wife, Sophie, by the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914. Princip and other nationalists were struggling to end Austro-Hungarian rule over Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The assassination of Franz Ferdinand set off a rapidly escalating chain of events: Austria-Hungary, like many countries around the world, blamed the Serbian government for the attack and hoped to use the incident as justification for settling the question of Serbian nationalism once and for all.

Kaiser Wilhelm II
Because mighty Russia supported Serbia, Austria-Hungary waited to declare war until its leaders received assurance from German leader Kaiser Wilhelm II that Germany would support their cause. Austro-Hungarian leaders feared that a Russian intervention would involve Russia’s ally, France, and possibly Great Britain as well.

On July 5, Kaiser Wilhelm secretly pledged his support, giving Austria-Hungary a so-called carte blanche, or “blank check” assurance of Germany’s backing in the case of war. The Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary then sent an ultimatum to Serbia, with such harsh terms as to make it almost impossible to accept.
World War I Begins
Convinced that Austria-Hungary was readying for war, the Serbian government ordered the Serbian army to mobilize and appealed to Russia for assistance. On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and the tenuous peace between Europe’s great powers quickly collapsed.

Within a week, Russia, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Serbia had lined up against Austria-Hungary and Germany, and World War I had begun.

The Western Front
According to an aggressive military strategy known as the Schlieffen Plan (named for its mastermind, German Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen), Germany began fighting World War I on two fronts, invading France through neutral Belgium in the west and confronting Russia in the east.

On August 4, 1914, German troops crossed the border into Belgium. In the first battle of World War I, the Germans assaulted the heavily fortified city of Liege, using the most powerful weapons in their arsenal—enormous siege cannons—to capture the city by August 15. The Germans left death and destruction in their wake as they advanced through Belgium toward France, shooting civilians and executing a Belgian priest they had accused of inciting civilian resistance. 
First Battle of the Marne
In the First Battle of the Marne, fought from September 6-9, 1914, French and British forces confronted the invading Germany army, which had by then penetrated deep into northeastern France, within 30 miles of Paris. The Allied troops checked the German advance and mounted a successful counterattack, driving the Germans back to north of the Aisne River.

The defeat meant the end of German plans for a quick victory in France. Both sides dug into trenches, and the Western Front was the setting for a hellish war of attrition that would last more than three years.

Particularly long and costly battles in this campaign were fought at Verdun (February-December 1916) and the Battle of the Somme (July-November 1916). German and French troops suffered close to a million casualties in the Battle of Verdun alone.

World War I Books and Art
The bloodshed on the battlefields of the Western Front, and the difficulties its soldiers had for years after the fighting had ended, inspired such works of art as “All Quiet on the Western Front” by Erich Maria Remarque and “In Flanders Fields” by Canadian doctor Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. In the latter poem, McCrae writes from the perspective of the fallen soldiers:

To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.

Published in 1915, the poem inspired the use of the poppy as a symbol of remembrance.

Visual artists like Otto Dix of Germany and British painters Wyndham Lewis, Paul Nash and David Bomberg used their firsthand experience as soldiers in World War I to create their art, capturing the anguish of trench warfare and exploring the themes of technology, violence and landscapes decimated by war.
The Eastern Front
On the Eastern Front of World War I, Russian forces invaded the German-held regions of East Prussia and Poland, but were stopped short by German and Austrian forces at the Battle of Tannenberg in late August 1914.
Despite that victory, Russia’s assault had forced Germany to move two corps from the Western Front to the Eastern, contributing to the German loss in the Battle of the Marne.

Combined with the fierce Allied resistance in France, the ability of Russia’s huge war machine to mobilize relatively quickly in the east ensured a longer, more grueling conflict instead of the quick victory Germany had hoped to win under the Schlieffen Plan.",benign

Security firms are warning about a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card.

The Zafi.D virus translates the Christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. Anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. Anti-virus firm Sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the Zafi virus.

Like many other Windows viruses, Zafi-D plunders Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. To be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. The attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic Christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.

The virus' subject line says ""Merry Christmas"" and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. The message in the body of the e-mail reads: ""Happy Holidays"" and this too is translated. On infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the PC to hand over control to the writer of the virus. The virus is thought to have spread most widely in South America, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria and Hungary. The original Zafi virus appeared in April this year. ""We have seen these hoaxes for several Christmases already, and personally I prefer traditional pen and paper cards, and we recommend this to all our clients too,"" said Mikko Hypponen, who heads F-Secure's anti-virus team.

Sun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.

Sun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.

The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said Sun's chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz. ""Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California. The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil, gas and financial services industries.

Some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said. Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. Hundreds of servers were used simultaneously, working on the problem for a few seconds each.

Although it only took a few seconds, the experiment cost $12 (Â£6.30) because it had used up 12 hour's worth of computing power. The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun. Initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. It has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in IBM, which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by Sun.

I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted
uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is
about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market.
Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there
are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar
Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources
(for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before
uranium reached $200/lb.
""Demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense.  Supply and
demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going
to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century?
Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built
at a sufficient rate.
Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or
a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of
self-sufficiency.

Gibraltar's Chief Minister Peter Caruana will represent the British citizens living on the Rock, while Britain's Europe Director Dominick Chilcott will represent the UK. Madrid is being represented by Spain's director general for Europe, Jose Maria Pons.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/technologie_14.txt,"Apple rejects flawed claims about its contact tracing tech

Apple has been forced to reject damaging claims against its contact tracing tech now circulating on Facebook.

Even as we consider revelations Facebook shelved internal research suggesting its algorithms generate divisiveness, Apple has been forced to reject damaging claims against its contact tracing tech currently spreading on Facebook.

Exposure Notification is not spying on you
Numerous hysterical myths concerning the Apple/Google contact tracing technology are being circulated on Facebook. A series of posts claim the Exposure Notification feature inside iOS 13.5 will allow authorities to track people’s locations and monitor who they meet – which is precisely what it tries not to do.

This is not correct.

[ Keep up on the latest thought leadership, insights, how-to, and analysis on IT through Computerworld’s newsletters. ]
The solution requires individuals use a government-approved app and that they consent to sharing any information. Not only this, but both Apple and Google have barred governments from harvesting GPS data or requiring users to share personal information when using the app.

An Apple spokesperson told Reuters:

“You will still need to download an app from a public health agency to use the Exposure Notifications feature.”

How it works
In order to work, the solution relies on random Bluetooth identifiers shared between devices. This information forms a record of proximity but does not include location data.

[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ]
When they announced their work, Apple and Google promised that any apps using the technology “must require users to consent before  sharing a positive test result, and the  ’keys’  associated with their devices, with  the public health authority.” Users should also be able to turn off exposure notifications at any time.

The tech firms are attempting to create a contact tracing solution that gathers as little personal information as possible, and have previously promised to delete the feature once the current crisis has passed.

The intention of the tech is that government or health authorities can use the API to build apps with which to monitor the disease outbreak.

What is contact tracing?
Contact tracing is seen as a way to help control the pandemic. The information should warn people when they have been exposed to the diseases.

This could enable life to return to something a little more like business as usual, while also saving lives – though the efficiency is limited if people refuse to use the apps.

The tech-based solution won’t be the only tool used for this: Many governments are hiring tens of thousands of human contact tracers to interview COVID-19 sufferers in order to find out who they have interacted with.

Apple and Google continue development
Apple and Google both released APIs for their technology earlier this month. These are designed to make it possible for both Android and iOS devices to work together for contact tracing using officially sanctioned government apps.

The two companies are also developing a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, they said in April.

“This is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities,” the companies explained at that time.

“Privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance in this effort, and we look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders.""

Who is using these apps ?
Apple and Google have said 23 countries and several U.S. states have requested access to its APIs. The first app to make use of the Apple/Google API has appeared in Switzerland, with a Latvian initiative not far behind.

There are some governments who want to gather all the information for analysis on servers they control, but the Apple/Google model does not enable this; instead, analysis takes place on the device.

The idea is that by retaining control of data on user devices, privacy is maintained.

Those countries attempting to gather this data in a far less private, centralized fashion are having problems creating solutions that actually work.

One app tested in the UK is glitchy, drains batteries and doesn’t work well between platforms, among other problems. That’s a shame, given that it now has a higher death rate per million than any other country in the world, and could probably use an effective solution.

Their Hiten engineering-test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric
Earth orbit doing lunar flybys, and then was inserted into lunar orbit
using some very tricky gravity-assist-like maneuvering.  This meant that
it would crash on the Moon eventually, since there is no such thing as
a stable lunar orbit (as far as anyone knows), and I believe I recall
hearing recently that it was about to happen.

Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.

The government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay. Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday. ""It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,"" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.

His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. ""We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,"" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement. ""It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak."" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to ""compromise"". The QCA said the potential ""step-change in participation and attainment"" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. ""Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,"" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of the QCA's concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. They may be content if it does not ""close too many doors"" in writing - whatever spin is put on it.

The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. ""One of the reasons why I'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,"" he said. ""If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity."" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in ""functional"" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a ""massive upheaval"". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.

IBM is spending $100m (Â£52m) over the next three years beefing up its commitment to Linux software.

The cash injection will be used to help its customers use Linux on every type of device from handheld computers and phones right up to powerful servers. IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical, research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use. IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software.

In 2004 IBM said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using Linux to help staff work together more closely. The money will be used to help this push towards greater collaboration and will add Linux-based elements to IBM's Workplace software. Workplace is a suite of programs and tools that allow workers to get at core business applications no matter what device they use to connect to corporate networks. One of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use Linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with Workplace. Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. In 2001 it put $300m into a three-year Linux program and has produced Linux versions of many of its programs. Linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs. They reason that more open scrutiny of software produces better programs and fuels innovation.

The debut of US television hit Desperate Housewives has helped lift Channel 4's January audience share by 12% compared to last year.

Other successes such as Celebrity Big Brother and The Simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass BBC Two for the first month since last July. BBC Two's share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with January 2004. Celebrity Big Brother attracted fewer viewers than its 2002 series.

Comedy drama Desperate Housewives managed to pull in five million viewers at one point during its run to date, attracting a quarter of the television audience. The two main television channels, BBC1 and ITV1, have both seen their monthly audience share decline in a year on year comparison for January, while Five's proportion remained the same at a slender 6.3%. Digital multi-channel TV is continuing to be the strongest area of growth, with the BBC reporting Freeview box ownership of five million, including one million sales in the last portion of 2004. Its share of the audience soared by 20% in January 2005 compared with last year, and currently stands at an average of 28.6%.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/technologie_2.txt,"China net cafe culture crackdown

Chinese authorities closed 12,575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004, the country's government said.

According to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally. Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. The move is the latest in a series of steps the Chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use.

The official Xinhua News Agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a ""safer environment for young people in China"". Rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. The 12,575 cafes were shut in the three months from October to December. China also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.

Net cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in their homes. This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. All the 100,000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. Logs of sites people visit are also kept. Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. During the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate. In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. At the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites. The Reporters Without Borders group said in a report that Chinese government technologies for e-mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world.

	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion
	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the
	    thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values
	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are
	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust""
	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system
	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local
	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100
	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer
	    ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a
	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with
	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows
	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in
	    Earth/moon space.

	""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by

	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron
	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times
	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma
	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds
	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities
	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and
	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm
	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure
	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically
	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power
	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens
	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the
	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages
	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I

International films will be given the same prominence as US films at next year's Sundance Film Festival, with movies dominated by the theme of war.

The independent film festival will feature two new international cinema competitions, during its 20-30 January season in Utah. Forty-two films will debut at Sundance, including The Liberace of Baghdad by British director Sean McAllister. The prestigious festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981.

""We have always had an international component, but from next year they will enter a jury competition,"" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. ""We wanted to give world cinema more emphasis and have now put it on par with the American dramatic and documentary competitions."" Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focus on countries and people under siege.

The Liberace of Baghdad features an Iraqi pianist hiding in a hotel as he waits for a visa, while Finnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya. Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, while French-Israeli production Wall looks at Israel's controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories. The 16 films competing in the new world cinema dramatic category include works from Germany, South Korea, Angola, China, Denmark and Australia.

Several Hollywood stars feature in the festival's American independent drama category, including Keanu Reeves and Benjamin Bratt. Vince Vaughn stars in quirky movie Thumbsucker while 21 Grams actress Naomi Watts plays a budding Hollywood actress in Ellie Parker. The top Grand Jury prize at this year's festival went to low budget sci-fi thriller Primer, written and directed by Shane Carruth. Morgan Spurlock earned the directing award for Super Size Me, which became an international box office hit.

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from
a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels
synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable
contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no
visible contrast bands.
To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255
different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,
etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these
frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote
directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.
Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print. Who'd have guessed?

At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Allied leaders stated their desire to build a post-war world that would safeguard itself against future conflicts of such devastating scale.
Some hopeful participants had even begun calling World War I “the War to End All Wars.” But the Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, would not achieve that lofty goal.

Saddled with war guilt, heavy reparations and denied entrance into the League of Nations, Germany felt tricked into signing the treaty, having believed any peace would be a “peace without victory,” as put forward by Wilson in his famous Fourteen Points speech of January 1918.

As the years passed, hatred of the Versailles treaty and its authors settled into a smoldering resentment in Germany that would, two decades later, be counted among the causes of World War II.",benign
/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/business_2.txt,"Japanese growth grinds to a halt

Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.

Output in the period grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%. Exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.

The economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. One result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending.

The effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery. But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive.

The performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around. ""Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,"" said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. ""Personal consumption looks good, but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics. ""The amber light is flashing."" The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with Japan's massive public debt.

Why didn't you create 8 grey-level images, and display them for

This requires the same total exposure time, and the same precision in

The New York music studio where John Lennon spent his final hours is to close next month.

The Hit Factory, which opened 37 years ago, has played host to some of the biggest stars in music, including Paul Simon, Madonna and David Bowie. However, the rise in digital recording has affected business at the studio, which is relocating to smaller premises in Miami. Lennon recorded his final album Double Fantasy at the studio in 1979.

The studio was founded by Jerry Ragovoy in 1968. In 1975 it was sold to fellow producer Edward Germano, who turned it into a 100,000 square foot studio with seven recording rooms and live mastering suites. His first client was Stevie Wonder, who recorded part of his classic album Songs In The Key Of Life there. Other well-known albums to be recorded or partially recorded at the studio include Bruce Springsteen's Born In The USA, the Rolling Stones' Emotional Rescue and Paul Simon's Graceland. Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, Jay-Z and Beyonce are also among artists who have used the Hit Factory in the past, as well as 50 Cent who survived an attempt on his life as he left the premises in 2000.

Finding a disk array that can do 180MB/sec. will be difficult. The fastest
ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They
can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec. (64 bit). For these kinds of data
rates you need more than SCSI for connections. Their latest model, the
RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a
limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not
exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. They are also not
idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a
small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. They
still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.

might come close to maximum burst rate.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/technologie_13.txt,"Fact: Chrome rules the world.

Now with 69.2% of the world's browser user share – a measure of browser activity calculated by California-based analytics company Net Applications – Google's Chrome has no equal, at least in popularity. Rivals like Microsoft's Edge, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple's Safari eke out single digits, while niche browsers under them fight over the smallest scraps.

It's no surprise, then, that when Chrome speaks, everyone listens, whether about each browser upgrade – something Computerworld tracks in the What's in the latest Chrome update? series – or about Google's plans for the future.

Every Chrome upgrade is accompanied by enterprise-centric release notes that highlight some of the planned additions, substitutions, enhancements and modifications. We've collected the most important for this what's-coming round-up.

Just remember, nothing is guaranteed. As Google says: ""They might be changed, delayed, or canceled before launching to the Stable channel.""

Chrome 84: Full-page TLS 1.0, 1.1 warnings
Last year, Google spelled out the stages of warnings it would put in front of Chrome users about obsolete TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0 or 1.1 encryption. A first step – a ""Not Secure"" alert in the address bar – was taken in January 2020.

With Chrome 81, the browser was to display a full-page interstitial alert that interrupted attempts to reach the destinations secured with TLS 1.0 or 1.1. That schedule, however, was abandoned in early April.

[ Become a Microsoft Office 365 administrator in record time with this quick start course from PluralSight. ]
Now, it's Chrome 84, slated for release July 14, that is to contain the page-sized warning.

IT administrators can disable both warnings with the SSLVersionMin policy. Setting that policy to ""tls1"" allows Chrome to connect to TLS 1.0- and 1.1-encrypted sites sans alerts. The SSLVersionMin policy will work until January 2021, when it will be deprecated.

Chrome 84: Risky downloads, rescheduled
Starting with Chrome 84, the browser will warn users when executable files begin their downloading from a secure page (one marked as HTTPS) but actually transfer their bits over an insecure HTTP connection. ""These cases are especially concerning because Chrome currently gives no indication to the user that their privacy and security are at risk,"" Joe DeBlasio, a software engineer on the Chrome security team, wrote in a Feb. 6 post announcing the scheme.

At the time, Chrome 81 was pegged to begin the warnings. But as with the TLS 1.0 and 1.1 alerts, these were rescheduled in early April, pushed back to later versions of the browser. Google did not say aloud what prompted the change, but it likely was related to the March decision to pause Chrome's release cadence and when distribution was restored, abandon Chrome 82, skipping from 81 to May's 83.

With Chrome 85, set to ship Aug.25, Google will drop the hammer, barring those executable files from downloading.

Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (Â£53).

He told the World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be "" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood"". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, ""We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.

""The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory."" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.

While the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. ""We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook."" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. ""Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months."" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. ""In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.""

Microsoft has said it will replace more than 14 million power cables for its Xbox consoles due to safety concerns.

The company said the move was a ""preventative step"" after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables. It affects Xboxes made before 23 October 2003 for all regions but mainland Europe - and consoles in that region made before 13 January 2004. Microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables. The firm said fewer than one in 10,000 consoles had experienced component failures. The recall affects almost three quarters of all Xboxes sold around the world since its launch in 2001.

In a statement, it added: ""In almost all instances, any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console."" But in seven cases, customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand. In 23 cases, customers reported smoke damage, or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre. ""This is a preventative step we're choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents,"" said Robbie Bach, senior vice president, Microsoft home and entertainment division. ""We regret the inconvenience, but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do."" Consumers can order a new cable from the Xbox website or by telephoning 0800 028 9276 in the UK. Microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order. It advised users to turn off their Xboxes when not in use. A follow-up to Xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of 2006.

With World War I having effectively settled into a stalemate in Europe, the Allies attempted to score a victory against the Ottoman Empire, which entered the conflict on the side of the Central Powers in late 1914.
After a failed attack on the Dardanelles (the strait linking the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean Sea), Allied forces led by Britain launched a large-scale land invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula in April 1915. The invasion also proved a dismal failure, and in January 1916 Allied forces staged a full retreat from the shores of the peninsula after suffering 250,000 casualties.

Next year will be ""make or break"" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.

The chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.

He also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria. The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries.""

His proposals were effectively a new ""Marshall Plan"" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued. The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.

Mr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. But with 30,000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed, including 100% debt relief multilaterally. ""That is why next year is a test,"" he said. ""If after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them, then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results."" The Catholic aid agency Cafod will host Mr Brown's speech on Wednesday.

Cafod wants Britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the US to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. Oxfam's Paying the Price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. The charity's director, Barbara Stocking, said: ""2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure."" The report said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.

But 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a ""scar"" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. But Band Aid founder Bob Geldof in July said he was sick of hearing ""guff"" about scars on the world. It was pathetic that Britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added. Conservative shadow international development secretary Alan Duncan accused Mr Brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million Africans by 2005. Instead, only 500,000 people would benefit, he said. ""There's no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has,"" added Mr Duncan.

The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has admitted before a New York court that he used to lie to fellow board members.

Speaking at the trial of his former boss Bernard Ebbers, Scott Sullivan said he lied to the board to cover up the hole in WorldCom's finances. Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. The firm had been overstating its accounts by $11bn (Â£8.5bn). Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers' trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances.

In the New York court on Wednesday, Mr Ebbers' lawyer Reid Weingarten asked Mr Sullivan: ""If you believe something is in your interest, you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it, isn't that right?""

""On that date, yes. I was lying,"" replied Mr Sullivan. Mr Weingarten has suggested that Mr Sullivan is implicating Mr Ebbers only to win a lighter sentence, something Mr Sullivan denies. Mr Sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow WorldCom board member Bert Roberts that Mr Ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at WorldCom. The trial of Mr Ebbers is now into its third week.

Under 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor, Mr Sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned Mr Ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet Wall Street revenue and earnings expectations. Mr Sullivan claims that Mr Ebbers refused to stop the fraud. Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom's problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. Prosecutors allege that the company's top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI.

Betty Boothroyd has said the House of Lords needs its own Speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber.

Baroness Boothroyd, who was the first woman to be Commons Speaker, said she believed Tony Blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind. ""Now we have to take care of it ourselves and make the best of it,"" she told the BBC's Breakfast with Frost. In 1999 Labour removed all but 92 of the Lords' 750 hereditary peers. That was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution. The lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next Labour manifesto.

""I think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the Lords and the Commons,"" Lord Falconer told BBC1's Breakfast With Frost. ""How it interacts with the Commons is a very, very important issue. ""We need to address the issue in the manifesto, but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes."" The lord chancellor currently has the role of House of Lords speaker. He is also head of the judiciary and a member of the Cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary.

Lady Boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of Speaker. ""I would really like to see a Speaker of the House of Lords,"" she said. ""I don't go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary, a senior Cabinet minister and Speaker of the Lords.

 My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny

 thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet ""reverse slingshot"" that leads to a
 weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet (at least a temporary one).

A decision on whether to allow Westminster to legislate on super-casinos is set to be made by the Scottish Parliament.

The government has plans for up to eight Las Vegas style resorts in the UK, one of which is likely to be in Glasgow. Scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in Scotland. But opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. The vote is due to be taken on Wednesday and is expected to be close.

The Scottish Executive believes that the legislation should be handled by Westminster. The new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. A super-casino in Glasgow could be located at Ibrox or the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. The new gambling bill going through Westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public, have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. But the Scottish National Party and the Tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in Scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.

Purists often distinguish between ""true"" clubbing and ""pseudo""
clubbing, the difference being that with ""true"" clubbing the
angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly
negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip).
With ""pseudo"" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then
negative, which is the normal situation. ""Real"" internists
can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple
of minutes.
Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is
entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists
love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only ""true"" clubbing
is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of
diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes
both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of
these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems
leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is
very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the 
congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac
catheterization. 
The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to
some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to
dilate abnormally. 
Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is
a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however,
the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/technologie_19.txt,"Intel unveils laser breakthrough

Intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light.

Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. The breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.

""We've overcome a fundamental limit,"" said Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab. Writing in the journal Nature, Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.

Telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. ""We're trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas,"" said Dr Paniccia. While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. This improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. ""It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,"" he said. But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. Even better, the laser light produced in this way can, with the help of easy-to-make filters, be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. Semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. The result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. ""It's a technical validation that it can work,"" he said.

The first minister's statement that it was okay to get drunk ""once in a while"" has diverted attention from the real issues, it has been claimed.

Jack Law, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said Jack McConnell's comment was ""ill-advised"". The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland's binge drinking problems, Mr Law said. Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been ""obscured"" by the remark. Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.

The one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were ""a recognition that people will get drunk"". Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: ""I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. ""If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it."" However, he added that ""perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage"".

Mr MacDonell said: ""I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. ""But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured."" Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland's fight against binge drinking. He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. Mr Law added: ""I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland.

""We don't want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. ""This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness."" He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were ""off the mark"", they were bound to ""come back and bite him"". He added: ""Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. ""I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.""

The Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his ""ill-judged comment"" and withdraw it immediately. In a furious response, the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. He told Ms Sturgeon: ""It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I 'should encourage young people to get drunk'. ""That is completely untrue. Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position, undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.""

British team member Hayley Yelling said the team would understand if Radcliffe opted out of the event. ""It would be fantastic to have Paula in the team,"" said the European cross-country champion. ""But you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus. ""She is not messing us around. We all understand the problem."" Radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year's event because of injury. In her absence, the GB team won bronze in Brussels.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/business_7.txt,"German jobless rate at new record

More than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures show.

The figure of 5.216 million people, or 12.6% of the working-age population, is the highest jobless rate in Europe's biggest economy since the 1930s. The news comes as the head of Germany's panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. Speaking on German TV, Bert Ruerup said the panel's earlier forecast of 1.4% was too optimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005.

The German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms. At their centre is the ""Hartz-IV"" programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised. The latest unemployment figures look set to increase the pressure on the government. Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day in advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrat-Green Party administration. Mr Schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment.

Still, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. The soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January. Adjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month. Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January. And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 new net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million. The ILO defines an unemployed person as someone who in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could take up immediately.

Northern Ireland man James McIlroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend's Spar European Indoor Championships in Madrid.

The 28-year-old has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the 800 metres favourites. ""I believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in Sheffield, I can run my race from the front, back or middle,"" said McIlroy. New coach Tony Lester has helped get McIlroy's career back on track. The 28-year-old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. McIlroy now lives in Windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former Army sergeant Lester. Lester is better known for his work with 400m runners Roger Black and Mark Richardson in the past but under his guidance McIlroy has secured five wins this indoor season.

McIlroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for Ireland at the outdoor European Championships in 1998. ""That was my last decent year,"" said McIlroy, who temporarily retired last August before returning to the sport under Lester's shrewd guidance. ""Before, every race was like trying to climb Mount Everest and I now know you can't do it on your own. ""Trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half-dead and terrified on the starting line, which became a bit too much."" McIlroy, who was compared to the likes of Sebastian Coe, Steve Cram and Steve Ovett in his younger days, is now competing without the benefit of National Lottery funding. That situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world-class times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in Erfurt and Stuttgart earlier this season. Russian Dmitriy Bogdanov won at the same Madrid venue last week and then claimed the European Championship race would be between himself, Dutchman Arnoud Okken and Antonio Reina of Spain but McIlroy is unfazed.

He admitted: ""He looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion. ""I never write myself off and let's face it, I haven't or looked like being beaten this season."" And McIlroy, whose time of one minute 46.68seconds in Erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the UK All-Time list, is also already looking beyond Madrid. He said: ""I've been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important. ""Ultimately of course, this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer's world championships. ""That ambition has meant that I've had only two nights out since last August. The rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.""

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/entertainment_7.txt,"Pupils to get anti-piracy lessons

Lessons on music piracy and copyright issues are to be taught to secondary school pupils in the UK.

The lessons, aimed at 11 to 14-year-olds, will introduce them to copyright - including the issues of downloading from the internet and the illegal copying of CDs - and its role in protecting creativity.

Music piracy, including illegally swapping music online, costs the UK music industry millions every year and has been blamed for a decline in world-wide CD sales. British Music Rights (BMR) - which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers - worked with education experts to put together a learning pack.

Songwriter Guy Chambers, who has worked with stars including Robbie Williams, has thrown his support behind the scheme. He said as well as educating children about music piracy, it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from ""unscrupulous"" individuals. At a debate in London to launch the scheme, Chambers said: ""I think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools. ""These lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers."" The education pack, which has already been requested by more than 1,600 secondary schools, is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry. It will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry, particularly in the digital age.

Henri Yoxall, general manager of British Music Rights, told BBC News schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues. The scheme - which is an extension of BMR's Respect the Value of Music campaign - is also being backed by singer-songwriters Feargal Sharkey, Lucie Silvas and Grammy Award-winning composer David Arnold. Silvas said: ""I think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how the music industry works when they are at a young age. ""I wish I had been given an opportunity like this when I was at school."" Emma Pike, director general of British Music Rights, said: ""We believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools. It is vital that the creatives of the future know how to turn their ideas into value. ""Copyright education has always been important... creatives are facing more challenges and more opportunities from technological change. ""Technology is allowing people to create music and distribute their music to the public in a whole host of new ways.""

David Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced ""prematurely"" via press release a review of murder laws.

The home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as ""a mess"". He said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year.

On Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales. News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday. He said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed his ""gracious apology"" and the review itself. But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be ""dragged"" to face MPs.

In its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. The panel suggested different kinds of murders could be ""graded"" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.

But the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. But it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was ""indefensible and should cease"".

A key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: ""Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. ""Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence."" The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.

Stephen Toulouse, a security manager at Microsoft, said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment. Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users.

It may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes.

Microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. Earlier this week, Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software. Microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet set a date for its release. The anti-spyware program being targeted is currently only in beta form and aims to help users find and remove spyware - programs which monitor internet use, causes advert pop-ups and slow a PC's performance.

    Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color

       3         large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla

This recipe makes about 4 dozen very crunchy biscotti.  I've never put chocolate on the biscotti.  You need two 12x15 inch (approx.) cookie sheets.  Butter and flour ONE of the cookie sheets.  The oven should be at 350 to roast the almonds, and 300 to bake the biscotti.  Total baking time for the biscotti is about 2 hours.  You also need to have handy and ready a surface for kneading the biscotti dough and a surface for cutting the baked biscotti.  Roast the almonds in a 350 degree often until lightly browned (10-15 minutes).  Cool nuts completely. Lower the oven temperature to 300.  In a medium bowl, stir together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, salt) just to mix.  Separate out about 1/2 cup of this mixture, and spread SOME of the reserved 1/2 cup onto your kneading surface.  In a small bowl or measuring cup, lightly beat together the eggs and vanilla.  Make a well in the flour mixture in the medium bowl and pour in the egg/vanilla mixture.  Stir the flour into the egg mixture from the outside of the well.  Continue combining until the mixture is too stiff to stir.  Turn the mixture out onto your kneading surface, which should already be floured with some of the reserved dry ingredients.  With floured hands (use some of the reserved dry ingredients for this if you want), fold the dough over itself until it coheres.  Use the rest of the reserved dry ingredients for your hands and the work surface, if necessary.  Press the nuts into the dough and keep folding the dough over itself until the nuts are evenly distributed.  Let the dough sit a few minutes so the flour absorbs the liquid completely, making the dough less sticky.  Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece with your hands so that the pieces are elongated into strips about 1"" wide and 12""-14"" long. *** Place the strips on the buttered/floured baking sheet, leaving about 4"" between each strip.  If you want somewhat wider strips, flatten the strips with your hands to a width of 2"".  Bake for about 50 minutes at 300.  Let the strips cool for 5 minutes, and them remove them with a spatula to a cutting surface.  Using a sharp knife and making downward strokes, cut the strips into diagonal bars about 1/2"" wide.  Lay the cut biscotti on their sides on the two baking sheets.  Toast 35-50 minutes, depending on how dark (and crunchy?) you want them.  *** To make much wider strips, divide the dough into two strips, same length (12""-14"").  Each cookie will be about 6"" long.  This should make about 2 dozen cookies.

British triple jumper Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury, according to reports.

It was hoped she would be able to return this summer, but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal. Her coach Aston Moore told the Times: ""We're not looking at any sooner than 2006, not as a triple jumper.""

""There was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months, but that has been solved and we can push ahead now,"" he said. ""The aim is for her to get fit as an athlete - then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena.""

""It's been a frustrating time for her, but it has not fazed her determination,"" he added.

The £10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday.

It says the UK Treasury has allocated £7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly. The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast cross-London rail link. The paper says it will go before the House of Commons on 23 February.

A second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March. ""We've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case,"" the Department for Transport said on Sunday. Jeremy de Souza, a spokesman for Crossrail, said on Sunday he could not confirm whether the Treasury was planning to invest £7.5bn or when the bill would go before Parliament.

However, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election.

The new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of London, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. Heathrow to the City would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube. The line has the support of the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, business groups and the government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded. The Mail on Sunday's Financial Mail said the £7.5bn of Treasury money was earmarked for spending in £2.5bn instalments in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/technologie_20.txt,"Security scares spark browser fix

Microsoft is working on a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser.

The revamp has been prompted by Microsoft's growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. Microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. Test versions of the new program, called IE 7, are due to be released by the summer.

The announcement about Internet Explorer was made by Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the RSA Security conference currently being held in San Francisco. Although details were scant, Mr Gates, said IE7 would include new protections against viruses, spyware and phishing scams. This last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information.

In a bid to shore up the poor security in IE 6, Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. Earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the IE browser. Microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. One of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a Microsoft anti-spyware program. An own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. The decision to make Internet Explorer 7 is widely seen as a U-turn because, before now, Microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. Typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the Windows operating system. A new version of IE was widely expected to debut with the next version of Windows, codenamed Longhorn, which is due to appear in 2006. The current version of Internet Explorer is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as Firefox and Opera. There are also persistent rumours that search engine Google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on Firefox. In particular the Firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in November 2004. Estimates of how many users Firefox has won over vary widely. According to market statistics gathered by Websidestory, Firefox's market share is now about 5% of all users. However, other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%. Some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the Firefox browser. Internet Explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004.

A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in Peru.

The pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital Lima, aims to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay-Huaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions. More than 13,000 rural inhabitants, as well as 18,000 students in the region, will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.

The 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September.

The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) led the $200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the Education and Agriculture ministries, and European development organisations. ""The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system,"" said Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes. Farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. The Board of Irrigation Users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.

One of the key elements of the project is the Agricultural Information System, with its flagship huaral.org website. There, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. The system also helps the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. ""Water is the main element that unites them all. It is a precious element in Peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it,"" Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website. The information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world.

Cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project's success. ""Throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them,"" said Mr Saldarriaga. The community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. ""We have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. But we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives."" So far, the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in Peru. ""This is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places,"" underlined Mr Saldarriaga.

The Cepes researcher recalls what happened in Cuyo, a 50-family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site. There it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kW worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights. ""It was already dark when the technicians realised they didn't have any light bulbs to test the generator, so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs,"" recalls Carlos Saldarriaga. ""The logical answer was 'we don't sell any', so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing."" Now, with the wireless network, Cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.

Downing Street has confirmed British troops are on standby in case they need to help evacuate several hundred UK citizens from Ivory Coast.

The news came as it emerged France had begun evacuating its hostages after days of anti-French demonstrations. Trouble flared after nine French peacekeepers were killed and President Jacques Chirac ordered the destruction of the Ivory Coast's air force. A company of 100-120 UK troops is understood to have been put on standby. They are ready to fly out and secure the route from the embassy to the airport if called upon. Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said: ""There are British nationals in Ivory Coast and as you can imagine we are making the usual contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates further, but that's all I can say at this stage.""

He added the situation would be monitored carefully in case evacuation became necessary. France has played a lead role in international peacekeeping in Ivory Coast - a former colony - after President Laurent Gbagbo broke an 18-month ceasefire with rebels bombing their positions and killing the nine French soldiers. The decision to destroy the African nation's small air force prompted riots against French and other foreign nationals. The Spanish have already put their forces on standby to evacuate their nationals if necessary.

At the outbreak of fighting in 1914, the United States remained on the sidelines of World War I, adopting the policy of neutrality favored by President Woodrow Wilson while continuing to engage in commerce and shipping with European countries on both sides of the conflict.

Neutrality, however, was increasing difficult to maintain in the face of Germany’s unchecked submarine aggression against neutral ships, including those carrying passengers. In 1915, Germany declared the waters surrounding the British Isles to be a war zone, and German U-boats sunk several commercial and passenger vessels, including some U.S. ships.

Widespread protest over the sinking by U-boat of the British ocean liner Lusitania—traveling from New York to Liverpool, England with hundreds of American passengers onboard—in May 1915 helped turn the tide of American public opinion against Germany. In February 1917, Congress passed a $250 million arms appropriations bill intended to make the United States ready for war.

Germany sunk four more U.S. merchant ships the following month, and on April 2 Woodrow Wilson appeared before Congress and called for a declaration of war against Germany.",benign

Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Tony Blair of performing U-turns over rules on using force against burglars.

The government has ruled out amending the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence. Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: ""It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars."" Home Secretary Charles Clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using ""grossly disproportionate"" force could be prosecuted. The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. He told MPs: ""If we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law."" Instead, the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. He said: ""We've had three policy positions in three months and two U-turns. ""It's not surprising Gordon Brown told him: 'There's nothing you could say to me now that I could ever believe.'""

Mr Howard said the ""grossly disproportionate"" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. The issue entered the public spotlight when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. The barrister who had represented Mr Martin had said the rules were ""weighted overwhelmingly"" in favour of the householder, said Mr Clarke. He said: ""The problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point Sir John Stevens was making and the prime minister was making."" The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr Clarke. The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. Those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said. Tory MP Patrick Mercer's private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in Parliament on Wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.

Re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too.

Research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. The Forum for the Future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. But the Forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites.

The report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the UK. Of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year, only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. The slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future. ""It's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around,"" said Mr Goodman.

Many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world, said Mr Goodman. Far better, he said, to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. ""We've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back,"" said Mr Goodman, ""but there's a strong social argument too."" Older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. ""It's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network,"" said Mr Goodman, ""and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones."" But the relatively low wages in Romania, which is one of the poorest countries in Europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. ""The affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one,"" he said. Reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of Romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. The re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, said: ""Normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. I am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me."" ""This is the only way I can afford to have a phone,"" she said. Mr Goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of Britain's mobile mountain made it overseas. But, he added, those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. ""If its more than a few years old people are not going to want it,"" he said.

Tony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.

In a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""No politician should make the mistake that John Major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.

""That is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of Labour's programme.

In a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term"".

""In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" Mr Blair said. In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: ""He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK. We're not so sure."" David Page, of Investec Securities, said: ""His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of Â£8bn is way too optimistic. ""It's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.""

Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""I can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. ""In order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election."" Mr Letwin accused the chancellor of using ""fancy statistics"" to hide public service failures. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his ""golden rule"". ""It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,"" Mr Cable told MPs.

Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.

The pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. ""A decision is now expected by around mid-March,"" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry. The athletes also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the Athens test, which led to them spending four days in hospital. Following the final hearing in late January, the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted. ""I am confident and optimistic,"" Thanou had said at the time. ""We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of."" It was not clear what this new evidence was.

The decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month was passed 8-1 by the Bank of England's rate-setting body, minutes have shown.

One member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - Paul Tucker - voted to raise rates to 5%. The news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision. Worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates, the minutes showed. The Bank's latest inflation report, released last week, had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending.

However, MPC member Paul Tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to 5%. He argued that economic growth was picking up, and that the equity, credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected.

The Bank's minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were ""sufficiently to the downside"" to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting. However, the minutes added: ""Some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection"". Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon. He said the minutes appeared to be ""trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates"". ""If the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates."" However, he added, any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year, with MPC members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/historical_9.txt,"Weeks after arriving in Germany, Yamashita was presented to Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader. Each had his own objective for the meeting. Hitler intended to pressure the Japanese military into declaring war on Britain and the United States. Facing the wrath of Russia and the ongoing costs of Japan’s war on China, however, Yamashita had no interest. Instead, he hoped to inspect Germany’s military techniques and improve Japan’s own prospects at war. Despite Hitler’s hearty promises of an open exchange of information, the Japanese delegation’s questions about radar and other equipment were tossed aside by top Nazi officials. The Japanese were instead treated to a kind of “greatest hits” tour of German military sites around occupied territories.
Privately, Yamashita was underwhelmed by the Führer. “He may be a great orator on a platform,” he told staff, “but standing behind his desk listening, he seems much more like a clerk.” Nonetheless, he played up the relationship publicly, telling the Berlin correspondent of the Asahi newspaper that Hitler had been profoundly influenced by Japan’s military power since boyhood. “Hitler emphasized that in the coming age the interests of Japan and Germany would be identical as the two have common spiritual foundations,” he said. “Hitler and Mussolini are united [with Japan] not from any consideration of interest but from a thorough spiritual understanding.”

Germany and Japan had a mutual interest in gold.
The understanding may have been spiritual in part—but it was financial, too. In 1938, the Third Reich looted Europe’s gold reserves, giving Germany as much as 100 metric tons of hard currency. In the years that followed, the Nazis seized gold from central banks in Poland, Belgium, Holland and the Netherlands, prompting the United Kingdom to ship its gold to Ottawa for safekeeping. Japan, meanwhile, seems to have plundered the rich gold resources of Northeast China, as well as other Asian territories, giving rise to later stories about vast hordes of treasure being hidden by Yamashita in the Philippines.

As the conflict continued and Germany’s resources began to run dry, Japan extended a hand: In 1944, the Japanese submarine I-52 was sunk by Allied forces. It was believed to be on a mission to deliver more than two tons of gold, in addition to opium, metal and other raw materials, to the Nazi war machine",benign

China's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.

The curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a ""hard landing"" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down from 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.

The Allies successfully pushed back the German offensive and launched their own counteroffensive just three days later.

After suffering massive casualties, Germany was forced to call off a planned offensive further north, in the Flanders region stretching between France and Belgium, which was envisioned as Germanyâ€™s best hope of victory.

Kostas Kenteris' lawyer has called for the doping charges against the Greek sprinter to be dropped.

Gregory Ioannidis has submitted new evidence to a Greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former Olympic champion has no case to answer. Kenteris and compatriot Katerina Thanou were given provisional suspensions in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. The Greek tribunal is expected to give its verdict early next week. Kenteris and Thanou withdrew from the Athens Olympics last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. They were also alleged to have avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games.

But Ioannidis said: ""Everything overwhelmingly shows that the charges should be dropped."" Ioannidis also said he has presented evidence that will throw a different light on the events leading up to the pair's sensational withdrawal from the Athens Games.

The world's biggest confectionery firm, Cadbury Schweppes, has reported a modest rise in profits after the weak dollar took a bite out of its results.

Underlying pre-tax profits rose 1% to £933m ($1.78bn) in 2004, but would have been 8% higher if currency movements were stripped out. The owner of brands such as Dairy Milk, Dr Pepper and Snapple generates more than 80% of its sales outside the UK. Cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005. ""While the external commercial environment remains competitive, we are confident that we have the strategy, brands and people to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005,"" said chief executive Todd Stitzer.

The modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in December that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in Europe.

Cadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004. Growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including Cadbury, Trident and Halls - which enjoyed a ""successful"" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%. Drinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in US carbonated soft drinks, led by Dr Pepper and diet drinks, offset by the weaker sales in Europe. Cadbury added that its Fuel for Growth cost-cutting programme had saved £75m in 2004, bringing total cost savings to £100m since the scheme began in mid-2003. The programme is set to close 20% of the group's factories and shed 10% of the workforce. Cadbury Schweppes employs more than 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the UK.

The WRAZ-TV Fox affiliate in North Carolina was the only one of 182 stations to refuse Monday's show. Who's Your Daddy promises $100,000 (£52,000) to the contestant if she correctly identifies her father. It was met with protests by the National Council for Adoption, which said it ""exploits"" sensitive emotions. ""It exploits the sensitive emotions of adoption,"" said Thomas Atwood, president of the National Council for Adoption. ""It trivialises them. Adoption is a very personal, meaningful experience and it should not be commercialised like this.""

If she picks the correct man from the line-up, the contestant wins the jackpot prize of US$100,000 (£52,590). However, if she picks the wrong man, then the impostor takes the money. Fox producers defended the show, saying it was a ""positive experience"". They have made six specials, though only one episode has so far been broadcast.

""The special was thoroughly vetted by our standards and practices department to ensure that it was appropriate for broadcast,"" said a Fox spokesman. ""However, any network affiliate that feels the programming may be inappropriate for their individual market has the right to pre-empt the schedule.""

An Indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country.

Tata Teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network. The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections. In 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations.

""In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task,"" said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata. ""Heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult,"" he said. In some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. He said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. This has led Chennai-based Tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between Tata's core network and the premises of customers. The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. The hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses.

The laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but Tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps. The lasers are also ideal for India because of its climate. ""It's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy,"" he said. In places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr Sridharan. ""Once we get the other permissions, normal time period for set up is a few hours,"" he said. By contrast, he said, digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. This speed of set up has helped Tata with its aggressive expansion plans. Just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities. But by the end of March the firm hopes to reach more than 1,000. ""Speed is very important because of the pace of competition,"" said Mr Sridharan.

From 1914 to 1916, Russia’s army mounted several offensives on World War I’s Eastern Front, but was unable to break through German lines.

Defeat on the battlefield, combined with economic instability and the scarcity of food and other essentials, led to mounting discontent among the bulk of Russia’s population, especially the poverty-stricken workers and peasants. This increased hostility was directed toward the imperial regime of Czar Nicholas II and his unpopular German-born wife, Alexandra.

Russia’s simmering instability exploded in the Russian Revolution of 1917, spearheaded by Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks, which ended czarist rule and brought a halt to Russian participation in World War I.

Russia reached an armistice with the Central Powers in early December 1917, freeing German troops to face the remaining Allies on the Western Front.

During the Spanish-American War, rebels in the Philippines proclaimed their independence after 300 years of Spanish rule… only to have their hopes for a free nation written off with a few pen strokes when the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1898, handing the Philippines to the United States. Rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo—who had convened a revolutionary assembly that drew up the first democratic constitution in Asia—launched a revolt. 

The United States responded by sending in troops and by war’s end, over 4,000 American soldiers had died, ten times the number of Americans killed in the Spanish-American War. Losses among locals were worse: 20,000 Filipino insurgents and an unknown number of civilians lost their lives in the fight for independence.

Search engine firm Google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.

The AutoLink feature comes with Google's latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to Amazon.com if it finds a book's ISBN number on the site. It also links to Google's map service, if there is an address, or to car firm Carfax, if there is a licence plate. Google said the feature, available only in the US, ""adds useful links"". But some users are concerned that Google's dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like Amazon.

AutoLink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission.

If a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazon's website. It could mean online libraries that list ISBN book numbers find they are directing users to Amazon.com whether they like it or not. Websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services. Dan Gillmor, founder of Grassroots Media, which supports citizen-based media, said the tool was a ""bad idea, and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth"". In a statement Google said the feature was still only in beta, ie trial, stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. It said: ""The user can choose never to click on the AutoLink button, and web pages she views will never be modified. ""In addition, the user can choose to disable the AutoLink feature entirely at any time.""

The new tool has been compared to the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft by some users. It was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by Microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. Smart Tags allowed Microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. Google said none of the companies which received AutoLinks had paid for the service. Some users said AutoLink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any ""click through"" to a commercial site. Cory Doctorow, European outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group Electronic Fronter Foundation, said that Google should not be penalised for its market dominance. ""Of course Google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses. ""But as an end user I would want to know - 'Can I choose to use this service?, 'How much is Google being paid?', 'Can I substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by Google?'."" Mr Doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using AutoLink or ""tricked into using the service"".

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/technologie_5.txt,"Technology gets the creative bug

The hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required.

Often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision. But that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration. And vice versa. UK telco BT is serious about the idea and has launched its Connected World initiative. The idea, says BT, is to shape a ""21st Century model"" which will help cement the art, technology, and business worlds together. ""We are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology,"" said Frank Stone, head of the BT's business sector programmes. He looks after several ""centres of excellence"" which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations, one of which is focused on creative industries.

To mark the initiative's launch, a major international art installation is to open on 15 April in Brussels, with a further exhibit in Madrid later in the summer. They have both been created using the telco's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm, including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. Using a 3D graphics engine, the type commonly used in gaming, Bafta-winning artists Langlands & Bell have created a virtual, story-based, 3D model of Brussels' Coudenberg Cellars.

They have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of Coudenberg Palace, an historical seat of European power. The 3D world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th Century. ""The river was integral to the city's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared,"" said the artists. ""We hope that by uncovering the river, we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present, and appreciate the flow of modernity, once concealing, but now revealing the River Senne."" In their previous works they used the Quake game graphics engine. The game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering, game AI, and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game. They are so time-consuming and expensive to create, the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games. BT's own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners. It was also used in 2003 in Encounter, an urban-based, pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical, on-the-street action. Because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds, new features were added to Tara in order to handle the complex data sets. But collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new, and many keen coders, designers, games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself.

As more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street, enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance, creativity will become an integral part of technology. The Orange Expressionist exhibition last year, for example, displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the UK to create an interactive installation.

Technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential, not least because it gives people something to do with their technology. Big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too. The art world is ""fantastically rich"", said Mr Stone, with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like BT want to get in with them. Between 1997 and 2002, the creative industry brought Â£21 billion to London alone. It is an industry that is growing by 6% a year too. The partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net, according to Mr Stone. ""This is not just about putting art galleries and museums online,"" he said. ""It is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem."" With broadband penetration reaching 100% in the UK, businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it. The creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously. It is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries, or more patent ideas for tech companies. ""What we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking. ""We are creating a future cultural drive for the economy,"" said Mr Stone.

Sonia O'Sullivan has indicated that she would like to participate in next month's World Cross Country Championships in St Etienne.

Athletics Ireland have hinted that the 35-year-old Cobh runner may be included in the official line-up for the event in France on 19-20 March. Provincial teams were selected after last Saturday's Nationals in Santry and will be officially announced this week. O'Sullivan is at present preparing for the London marathon on 17 April. The participation of O'Sullivan, currentily training at her base in Australia, would boost the Ireland team who won the bronze three years agio. The first three at Santry last Saturday, Jolene Byrne, Maria McCambridge and Fionnualla Britton, are automatic selections and will most likely form part of the long-course team. O'Sullivan will also take part in the Bupa Great Ireland Run on 9 April in Dublin.

Actor Daniel Day-Lewis is to be presented with an award for his career in film at the Berlin Film Festival.

The 47-year-old, whose credits include his Oscar-winning performance in My Left Foot, will be presented with the Berlinale Camera award on 15 February. The honour, awarded since 1986, honours figures in cinema that the festival feels ""particularly indebted to"". Man to Man, a historical epic starring Kristin Scott Thomas, opens the German festival on 10 February. A candid documentary about the life and career of singer George Michael, A Different Story will also be screened at the 10-day event. '

Day-Lewis has competed four times at the Berlin Film Festival, with films In The Name Of The Father (1994), The Crucible (1997), The Boxer (1998) and Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York (2003). The festival praises him for his ""sensational start"" with roles in My Beautiful Launderette and costume classic A Room With A View, and a ""great number of celebrated roles"" in subsequent productions. Japan's oldest film studio will also be honoured along with Day-Lewis. Shochiku film studios, which was founded 110 years ago, will become the first cinematic institution to receive the Berlinale Camera award. Famous Japanese directors including Akira Hurosawa have had films produced at the studio.

Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba set a new world record in winning the women's 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games.

Dibaba won in 14 minutes 32.93 seconds to erase the previous world indoor mark of 14:39.29 set by another Ethiopian, Berhane Adera, in Stuttgart last year. But compatriot Kenenisa Bekele's record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men's 3,000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon. Ireland's Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.89 as Bekele battled to second in 7:41.42. ""I didn't want to sit back and get out-kicked,"" said Cragg. ""So I kept on the pace. The plan was to go with 500m to go no matter what, but when Bekele made the mistake that was it. The race was mine."" Sweden's Carolina Kluft, the Olympic heptathlon champion, and Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak had winning performances, too. Kluft took the long jump at 6.63m, while Ceplak easily won the women's 800m in 2:01.52.

Country and Western musician Jerry Scoggins has died in Los Angeles at the age of 93, his family has said.

Scoggins was best remembered for singing the theme tune to popular US TV show The Beverly Hillbillies. The Texan-born singer approached the producers of the programme with theme tune The Ballad of Jed Clampett for the pilot which was screened in 1962. The show, which told the story of a poor man striking oil and moving to Beverly Hills, ran until 1971.

Scoggins' daugher Jane Kelly Misel said that her father never tired of the song and would sing it at least once a day. ""He'd sing it at birthdays and anniversaries and variety shows. He never stopped performing it,"" she said. When a film version of The Beverly Hillbillies was made in 1993, Scoggins came out of retirement to perform the theme tune. Scoggins sang the lyrics while bluegrass stars Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played guitar and banjo.

Brad Pitt, Robert De Niro and Hugh Grant have been added to the line-up for a two-hour US TV special to raise money for victims of the Asian tsunami.

Andy Garcia, Lucy Liu, Natalie Portman and Jay Leno are also among the new names for Saturday's Tsunami Aid. They will join A-list singers Madonna, Sir Elton John, Nelly and Usher plus actors Kevin Spacey, Halle Berry and George Clooney on the NBC broadcast. Viewers will be urged to phone in to make donations throughout the night. Norah Jones, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Maroon 5, Mary J Blige and Eric Clapton will give musical performances on the show described as ""A Concert of Hope"".

Catherine Zeta Jones, Michael Douglas, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore and Tim Robbins are among the other movie superstars due to put in an appearance. George Clooney recently reacted angrily to a TV host's suggestion that not all funds raised would go towards tsunami relief. Fox TV's Bill O'Reilly said he would be ""watching to see if the money gets to the tsunami victims"" and warned the celebrities taking part ""had better be involved all the way down the line"". But Clooney accused O'Reilly of creating a fuss for his own personal gain, saying viewers may now be ""afraid that their money will do no good"".

He urged O'Reilly to co-present the TV special, adding in a letter: ""We're not playing games here, we're trying to save lives. It's as simple as this - you're either with this joint effort or against it."" Organisers say all funds will go to the American Red Cross. The commercial-free benefit show will also be aired by a string of cable broadcasters and Clear Channel's radio stations across the US. In addition, performances will be available to buy on the internet as downloads from Sony's Connect music store. A similar TV benefit carried by all four primary US TV networks after the 11 September terror attacks raised more than $150m (Â£80m).


 - The Bangkok International Film Festival got under way on Thursday in the Thai capital in the shadow of the country's 5,300 deaths from the tsunami. The red carpet gala opening night was ditched in favour of a more subdued first night. Six different films were shown at six cinemas, with all money from ticket sales going to charity.

instructions
In a medium bowl, combine the turkey, onion, chili powder, lime zest, and half the cilantro. Season with the measured salt and some black pepper. Use your hands to gently combine. Divide the meat into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into an even 1/2-inch-thick patty. Use your thumb to make a shallow indentation in the center of each patty (this helps the burgers cook more evenly). Transfer the patties to a plate and set aside.
To make the guacamole, place the avocado in a small bowl and, with the back of a fork, mash it until it’s almost smooth. Add the tomato, the remaining cilantro, and the lime juice. Season with salt and stir to combine.
Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to medium-high, about 375°F to 425°F. When the grill is hot, use tongs to grab several layers of wadded paper towels, dip them in vegetable oil, and smear the grill pan’s ridges or outdoor grill’s grates (you can also apply cooking spray directly to the pan or grates).
Use a metal spatula to transfer the turkey patties to the pan or grill (close the lid if it’s the latter) and cook, undisturbed (don’t be tempted to press down on the patties!), until grill marks appear on the bottom, about 5 to 6 minutes. Flip the burgers, close the grill (if using), and cook until the patties are cooked through and an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F, about 6 minutes more. Add the cheese to the top of each patty for the last 4 minutes of cooking time. When the cheese melts, transfer the burgers to a warmed plate and tent loosely with foil for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, split and toast the buns on the grill.
Top each bottom bun with a turkey patty, divide the guacamole evenly among the patties, and cover with the bun tops. Serve immediately.",benign

A close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are ""false"".

Platon Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm. The pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky. Mr Lebedev said there were ""absurd contradictions"" in the case. Opening his defence, he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced, which also include allegations of tax evasion. ""To my embarrassment, I could not understand the file of complaints against me,"" he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev headed the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos.

Mr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the ""running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction"". The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (Â£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill. The company's effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the US - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in Texas.

Tomoyuki Yamashita and the Führer had their own separate agendas. Later, they would share a mutual interest in gold.
In December 1940, three months after Japan, Germany and Italy signed their “Tripartite Pact” World War II alliance, a convoy of Japanese military leaders headed for Berlin to learn from their new allies.

At the head of the group was General Tomoyuki Yamashita, a veteran militarist who had spent his entire adult life in the business of war-making. Now rising through the ranks of the Imperial Japanese Army, Yamashita’s ascent had barely begun. Within the space of a few years, he would grow famous worldwide as the “Tiger of Malaya”: a ferocious military leader and the brains behind the brutal Japanese conquest of Singapore.

Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs.

In its monthly security bulletin, it flagged up eight ""critical"" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes considered ""critical"" is more than usual. They affect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either automatically or manually, PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data.

One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as ""critical"". Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs.

Star Trek fans have taken out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times in an attempt to persuade TV executives not to scrap Star Trek: Enterprise.

Made by the UPN TV network, the latest spin-off from the hit sci-fi show is due to end in May after four series. But fans around the world have pitched in to pay for the advert, which had the headline ""Save Star Trek"". They are also asking the Sci-Fi Channel to pick it up from UPN and will stage a rally in Los Angeles on 25 February.

The advert described the Star Trek franchise as a ""cultural icon"". Enterprise stars former Quantum Leap actor Scott Bakula as Captain Archer and is set before the original 1960s Star Trek series. ""Captain Archer and the crew of the NX-01 need your help to continue their journeys!"" the advert said. It also included a cut-out coupon for fans to send to UPN's parent companies Paramount and Viacom plus the Sci-Fi Channel. It also urged supporters to join the rally outside the Paramount studios.

Fan website Trek United is hoping to raise $32m (£17m) from donations by the end of March to pay for a fifth series. More than $23,000 (£12,000) has been pledged so far, according to the site. The 98th and final episode of Star Trek: Enterprise will air in the US on 13 May. The fourth series has averaged 2.9 million viewers per episode - half the amount it got in its first series. Star Trek: Enterprise began in 2001 following other Star Trek spin-off series The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager.

The US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations.

In a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing. While the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in September, this was because more people were now actively seeking work.

The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast. In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000. The better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. ""It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year,"" said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons.

Other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week. ""It should empower the Fed to clearly do something,"" said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston. Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and neighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and September. The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the US's record trade deficit. There is also speculation that President Bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.

Verizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth $6.8bn (Â£3.6bn), reports say.

The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according to news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest. The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.

Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy.

MCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers. The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC's AT&T deal. Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.

Plans to create a US soap based on the BBC's EastEnders have reportedly been drawn up by the Fox TV network.

It said scripts have been commissioned for a series about a community of working class people in of Chicago. The original EastEnders was pulled from BBC America last year after it proved a failure in the ratings. US versions of other British hits have proved less successful across the Atlantic.

BBC comedy Coupling was remade with a US cast, but lost its primetime slot on the NBC network due to disappointing ratings. At home, EastEnders has been facing its own ratings battle, recently losing out to rival ITV soap Emmer dale. Primetime soaps on US television have made a recent comeback, following the success of ABC serial Desperate Housewives. The series takes a ""darkly comedic"" look at the goings-on of a group of characters living in the suburbs.

Welsh councils should set their taxes at ""reasonable levels"" after being given an average funding increase of 6%, says the assembly government.

Finance Minister Sue Essex said it was a ""good deal"" for local government. The £3.2bn settlement includes the ""full"" £7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown. But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. In addition, £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was ""confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels."" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that ""significant"" cuts to services may still be unavoidable. After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed. ""A limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems,"" said Mr Wellington. ""It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase."" On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds. Ms Essex said: ""I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. ""I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties."" She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, ""even for those people who have moved up a band"".

The settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex said: ""This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level."" Plaid Cymru's local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement ""hugely disappointing"". He said: ""Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger."" ""This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both."" Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mr German said: ""I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty."" Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change ""is taking spin to the very verge of deception"". He added: ""Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.""

Struggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to supply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV).

The two firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding, and say they expect to seal a final agreement by Spring 2005. The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.

In January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; Â£2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.

German airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003.

Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/business_11.txt,"Saab to build Cadillacs in Sweden

General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.

The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.

GM's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. But the group's new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM's cuts.

Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment's leaders do not agree.

GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.

Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (Â£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. ""We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,"" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was ""stupid"", he said.

In a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change ""customers' perceptions"" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.

}
```

**[Kotlin](https://github.com/requery/requery/wiki/Kotlin) specific support using property references and infix functions:**

```kotlin
data {
    val result = select(Person::class) where (Person::age gt 21) and (Person::name eq ""Bob"") limit 10
}
```

**Java 8 [streams](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html):**

```java
data.select(Person.class)
    .orderBy(Person.AGE.desc())
    .get()
    .stream().forEach(System.out::println);
```

**Java 8 optional and time support:**

```java
public interface Person {

    @Key @Generated
    int getId();

    String getName();
    Optional<String> getEmail();
    ZonedDateTime getBirthday();
}
```

**[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) [Observables](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html):**

```java
Observable<Person> observable = data
    .select(Person.class)
    .orderBy(Person.AGE.desc())
    .get()
    .observable();
```

**[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) observe query on table changes:**

```java
Observable<Person> observable = data
    .select(Person.class)
    .orderBy(Person.AGE.desc())
    .get()
    .observableResult().subscribe(::updateFromResult);
```

**Read/write separation** Along with immutable types optionally separate queries (reading)
and updates (writing):

```java
int rows = data.update(Person.class)
    .set(Person.ABOUT, ""student"")
    .where(Person.AGE.lt(21)).get().value();
```

Features
--------

- No Reflection
- Fast startup & performance
- No dependencies (RxJava is optional)
- Typed query language
- Table generation
- Supports JDBC and most popular databases (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Postgres and more)
- Supports Android (SQLite, RecyclerView, Databinding, SQLCipher)
- Blocking and non-blocking API
- Partial objects/refresh
- Upsert support
- Caching
- Lifecycle callbacks
- Custom type converters
- Compile time entity validation
- JPA annotations (however requery is not a JPA provider)

Reflection free
---------------

requery uses compile time annotation processing to generate entity model classes and mapping
attributes. On Android this means you get about the same performance reading objects from a query
as if it was populated using the standard Cursor and ContentValues API.

Query with Java
---------------

The compiled classes work with the query API to take advantage of compile time generated attributes.
Create type safe queries and avoid hard to maintain, error prone string concatenated queries.

Relationships
-------------

You can define One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many relations in your models using
annotations. Relationships can be navigated in both directions. Of many type relations can be loaded
into standard java collection objects or into a more efficient
[Result](http://requery.github.io/javadoc/io/requery/query/Result.html) type.
From a [Result](http://requery.github.io/javadoc/io/requery/query/Result.html)
easily create a Stream, RxJava Observable, Iterator, List or Map.

Many-to-Many junction tables can be generated automatically. Additionally the relation model is
validated at compile time eliminating runtime errors.

vs JPA
------

requery provides a modern set of interfaces for persisting and performing queries. Some key
differences between requery and JPA providers like Hibernate or EclipseLink:

- Queries maps directly to SQL as opposed to JPQL.
- Dynamic Queries easily done through a DSL as opposed to the verbose `CriteriaQuery` API.
- Uses easily understandable extended/generated code instead of reflection/bytecode weaving for
  state tracking and member access

Android
-------

Designed specifically with Android support in mind. See [requery-android/example](https://github.com/requery/requery/tree/master/requery-android/example)
for an example Android project using databinding and interface based entities. For more information
see the [Android](https://github.com/requery/requery/wiki/Android) page.

Supported Databases
-------------------
Tested on some of the most popular databases:

- PostgresSQL (9.1+)
- MySQL 5.x
- Oracle 12c+
- Microsoft SQL Server 2012 or later
- SQLite (Android or with the [xerial](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) JDBC driver)
- Apache Derby 10.11+
- H2 1.4+
- HSQLDB 2.3+

JPA Annotations
---------------

A subset of the JPA annotations that map onto the requery annotations are supported.
See [here](https://github.com/requery/requery/wiki/JPA-Annotations) for more information.

Upserts
-------

Upserts are generated with the appropriate database specific query statements:
- Oracle/SQL Server/HSQL: `merge into when matched/not matched`
- PostgresSQL: `on conflict do update` (requires 9.5 or later)
- MySQL: `on duplicate key update`

Using it
--------

Versions are available on bintray jcenter / maven central.

```gradle
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'io.requery:requery:1.6.1'
    compile 'io.requery:requery-android:1.6.1' // for android
    annotationProcessor 'io.requery:requery-processor:1.6.1'
}
```

## What Is BlurKit?
BlurKit is an extraordinarily easy to use and performant utility to render real time blur effects in Android.

<p align=""center"">
    <img alt='BlurKit Demo' src='.repo/bk-demo.gif' />
</p>

## Perfomance

BlurKit is faster than other blurring libraries due to a number of bitmap retrieval and drawing optimizations. We've been logging benchmarks for the basic high-intensity tasks for a 300dp x 100dp BlurView:

| Task                      | BlurKit time       | Avg. time without BlurKit |
| --------------------------| -------------------| -----------------------   |
| Retrieve source bitmap    | 1-2 ms             | 8-25 ms                   |
| Blur and draw to BlurView | 1-2 ms             | 10-50ms                   |

This results in an average work/frame time of 2-4ms, which will be a seamless experience for most users and apps.

## Setup
Add __BlurKit__ to the dependencies block of the app level `build.gradle`:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.alterac.blurkit:blurkit:1.1.0'
}
```

## Usage
### BlurLayout
Add a `BlurLayout` to your XML layout just like any other view.

```xml
<io.alterac.blurkit.BlurLayout
    android:id=""@+id/blurLayout""
    android:layout_width=""150dp""
    android:layout_height=""150dp""/>
```
In the `Main_Activity.java` you need to override the `onStart()` and `onStop()` methods to include the `BlurLayout` functionality.
```java
BlurLayout blurLayout;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    blurLayout = findViewById(R.id.blurLayout);
}

@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    blurLayout.startBlur();
}

@Override
protected void onStop() {
    blurLayout.pauseBlur();
    super.onStop();
}
```

The layout background will continuously blur the content behind it. If you know your background content will be somewhat static, you can set the layout `fps` to `0`. At any time you can re-blur the background content by calling `invalidate()` on the `BlurLayout`. 

```xml
<io.alterac.blurkit.BlurLayout
    android:id=""@+id/blurLayout""
    android:layout_width=""150dp""
    android:layout_height=""150dp""
    blurkit:blk_fps=""0"" />
```

Other attributes you can configure are the blur radius and the downscale factor. Getting these to work together well can take some experimentation. The downscale factor is a performance optimization; the bitmap for the background content will be downsized by this factor before being drawn and blurred.

```xml
<io.alterac.blurkit.BlurLayout
    android:id=""@+id/blurLayout""
    android:layout_width=""150dp""
    android:layout_height=""150dp""
    blurkit:blk_blurRadius=""12""
    blurkit:blk_downscaleFactor=""0.12""
    blurkit:blk_fps=""60"" />
```

### Creating BlurKit Outside Of A Layout
You can use the `BlurKit` class which has a few useful blurring utilities. Before using this class outside of a `BlurLayout`, you need to initialize `BlurKit`.

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        BlurKit.init(this);
    }
}
```

You can blur a `View`, or a `Bitmap` directly.

```java
// View
BlurKit.getInstance().blur(View src, int radius);

// Bitmap
BlurKit.getInstance().blur(Bitmap src, int radius);
```

You can also __fastBlur__ a `View`. This optimizes the view blurring process by allocating a downsized bitmap and using a `Matrix` with the bitmaps `Canvas` to prescale the drawing of the view to the bitmap.

```java
BlurKit.getInstance().fastBlur(View src, int radius, float downscaleFactor);
```



## Upcoming Features
- [ ] `SurfaceView` support
- [ ] Support for use outside of an `Activity` (dialogs, etc.)
- [ ] Enhance retrieval of background content to only include views drawn behind the `BlurLayout`.

#### ""Imitation Is The Sincerest Form Of Plagiarism"" - <sub><sup>anonymous</sup></sub>
Open source software like HikariCP, like any product, competes in the free market.  We get it.  We understand that product advancements, once public, are often co-opted.  And we understand that ideas can arise from the zeitgeist; simultaneously and independently.  But the timeline of innovation, particularly in open source projects, is also clear and we want our users to understand the direction of flow of innovation in our space.  It could be demoralizing to see the result of hundreds of hours of thought and research co-opted so easily, and perhaps that is inherent in a free marketplace, but we are not demoralized.  *We are motivated; to widen the gap.*

------------------------------
#### Configuration (knobs, baby!)
HikariCP comes with *sane* defaults that perform well in most deployments without additional tweaking. **Every property is optional, except for the ""essentials"" marked below.**

<sup>&#128206;</sup>&nbsp;*HikariCP uses milliseconds for all time values.*

&#128680;&nbsp;HikariCP relies on accurate timers for both performance and reliability. It is *imperative* that your server is synchronized with a time-source such as an NTP server. *Especially* if your server is running within a virtual machine.  Why? [Read more here](https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/171020). **Do not rely on hypervisor settings to ""synchronize"" the clock of the virtual machine. Configure time-source synchronization inside the virtual machine.**   If you come asking for support on an issue that turns out to be caused by lack time synchronization, you will be taunted publicly on Twitter.

##### Essentials

&#128288;``dataSourceClassName``<br/>
This is the name of the ``DataSource`` class provided by the JDBC driver.  Consult the
documentation for your specific JDBC driver to get this class name, or see the [table](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#popular-datasource-class-names) below.
Note XA data sources are not supported.  XA requires a real transaction manager like
[bitronix](https://github.com/bitronix/btm). Note that you do not need this property if you are using
``jdbcUrl`` for ""old-school"" DriverManager-based JDBC driver configuration.
*Default: none*

*- or -*

&#128288;``jdbcUrl``<br/>
This property directs HikariCP to use ""DriverManager-based"" configuration.  We feel that DataSource-based
configuration (above) is superior for a variety of reasons (see below), but for many deployments there is
little significant difference.  **When using this property with ""old"" drivers, you may also need to set
the  ``driverClassName`` property, but try it first without.**  Note that if this property is used, you may
still use *DataSource* properties to configure your driver and is in fact recommended over driver parameters
specified in the URL itself.
*Default: none*

***

&#128288;``username``<br/>
This property sets the default authentication username used when obtaining *Connections* from
the underlying driver.  Note that for DataSources this works in a very deterministic fashion by
calling ``DataSource.getConnection(*username*, password)`` on the underlying DataSource.  However,
for Driver-based configurations, every driver is different.  In the case of Driver-based, HikariCP
will use this ``username`` property to set a ``user`` property in the ``Properties`` passed to the
driver's ``DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, props)`` call.  If this is not what you need,
skip this method entirely and call ``addDataSourceProperty(""username"", ...)``, for example.
*Default: none*

&#128288;``password``<br/>
This property sets the default authentication password used when obtaining *Connections* from
the underlying driver. Note that for DataSources this works in a very deterministic fashion by
calling ``DataSource.getConnection(username, *password*)`` on the underlying DataSource.  However,
for Driver-based configurations, every driver is different.  In the case of Driver-based, HikariCP
will use this ``password`` property to set a ``password`` property in the ``Properties`` passed to the
driver's ``DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, props)`` call.  If this is not what you need,
skip this method entirely and call ``addDataSourceProperty(""pass"", ...)``, for example.
*Default: none*

##### Frequently used

&#9989;``autoCommit``<br/>
This property controls the default auto-commit behavior of connections returned from the pool.
It is a boolean value.
*Default: true*

&#8986;``connectionTimeout``<br/>
This property controls the maximum number of milliseconds that a client (that's you) will wait
for a connection from the pool.  If this time is exceeded without a connection becoming
available, a SQLException will be thrown.  Lowest acceptable connection timeout is 250 ms.
*Default: 30000 (30 seconds)*

&#8986;``idleTimeout``<br/>
This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the
pool.  **This setting only applies when ``minimumIdle`` is defined to be less than ``maximumPoolSize``.**
Idle connections will *not* be retired once the pool reaches ``minimumIdle`` connections.  Whether a
connection is retired as idle or not is subject to a maximum variation of +30 seconds, and average 
variation of +15 seconds.  A connection will never be retired as idle *before* this timeout.  A value
of 0 means that idle connections are never removed from the pool.  The minimum allowed value is 10000ms
(10 seconds).
*Default: 600000 (10 minutes)*

&#8986;``maxLifetime``<br/>
This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool.  An in-use connection will
never be retired, only when it is closed will it then be removed.  On a connection-by-connection
basis, minor negative attenuation is applied to avoid mass-extinction in the pool.  **We strongly recommend
setting this value, and it should be several seconds shorter than any database or infrastructure imposed
connection time limit.**  A value of 0 indicates no maximum lifetime (infinite lifetime), subject of
course to the ``idleTimeout`` setting.
*Default: 1800000 (30 minutes)*

&#128288;``connectionTestQuery``<br/>
**If your driver supports JDBC4 we strongly recommend not setting this property.** This is for 
""legacy"" drivers that do not support the JDBC4 ``Connection.isValid() API``.  This is the query that
will be executed just before a connection is given to you from the pool to validate that the 
connection to the database is still alive. *Again, try running the pool without this property,
HikariCP will log an error if your driver is not JDBC4 compliant to let you know.*
*Default: none*

&#128290;``minimumIdle``<br/>
This property controls the minimum number of *idle connections* that HikariCP tries to maintain
in the pool.  If the idle connections dip below this value and total connections in the pool are less than ``maximumPoolSize``,
HikariCP will make a best effort to add additional connections quickly and efficiently.
However, for maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands,
we recommend *not* setting this value and instead allowing HikariCP to act as a *fixed size* connection pool.
*Default: same as maximumPoolSize*

&#128290;``maximumPoolSize``<br/>
This property controls the maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach, including both
idle and in-use connections.  Basically this value will determine the maximum number of
actual connections to the database backend.  A reasonable value for this is best determined
by your execution environment.  When the pool reaches this size, and no idle connections are
available, calls to getConnection() will block for up to ``connectionTimeout`` milliseconds
before timing out.  Please read [about pool sizing](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing).
*Default: 10*

&#128200;``metricRegistry``<br/>
This property is only available via programmatic configuration or IoC container.  This property
allows you to specify an instance of a *Codahale/Dropwizard* ``MetricRegistry`` to be used by the
pool to record various metrics.  See the [Metrics](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/Dropwizard-Metrics)
wiki page for details.
*Default: none*

&#128200;``healthCheckRegistry``<br/>
This property is only available via programmatic configuration or IoC container.  This property
allows you to specify an instance of a *Codahale/Dropwizard* ``HealthCheckRegistry`` to be used by the
pool to report current health information.  See the [Health Checks](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/Dropwizard-HealthChecks)
wiki page for details.
*Default: none*

&#128288;``poolName``<br/>
This property represents a user-defined name for the connection pool and appears mainly
in logging and JMX management consoles to identify pools and pool configurations.
*Default: auto-generated*

##### Infrequently used

&#8986;``initializationFailTimeout``<br/>
This property controls whether the pool will ""fail fast"" if the pool cannot be seeded with
an initial connection successfully.  Any positive number is taken to be the number of 
milliseconds to attempt to acquire an initial connection; the application thread will be 
blocked during this period.  If a connection cannot be acquired before this timeout occurs,
an exception will be thrown.  This timeout is applied *after* the ``connectionTimeout``
period.  If the value is zero (0), HikariCP will attempt to obtain and validate a connection.
If a connection is obtained, but fails validation, an exception will be thrown and the pool
not started.  However, if a connection cannot be obtained, the pool will start, but later 
efforts to obtain a connection may fail.  A value less than zero will bypass any initial
connection attempt, and the pool will start immediately while trying to obtain connections
in the background.  Consequently, later efforts to obtain a connection may fail.
*Default: 1*

&#10062;``isolateInternalQueries``<br/>
This property determines whether HikariCP isolates internal pool queries, such as the
connection alive test, in their own transaction.  Since these are typically read-only
queries, it is rarely necessary to encapsulate them in their own transaction.  This
property only applies if ``autoCommit`` is disabled.
*Default: false*

&#10062;``allowPoolSuspension``<br/>
This property controls whether the pool can be suspended and resumed through JMX.  This is
useful for certain failover automation scenarios.  When the pool is suspended, calls to
``getConnection()`` will *not* timeout and will be held until the pool is resumed.
*Default: false*

&#10062;``readOnly``<br/>
This property controls whether *Connections* obtained from the pool are in read-only mode by
default.  Note some databases do not support the concept of read-only mode, while others provide
query optimizations when the *Connection* is set to read-only.  Whether you need this property
or not will depend largely on your application and database. 
*Default: false*

&#10062;``registerMbeans``<br/>
This property controls whether or not JMX Management Beans (""MBeans"") are registered or not.
*Default: false*

&#128288;``catalog``<br/>
This property sets the default *catalog* for databases that support the concept of catalogs.
If this property is not specified, the default catalog defined by the JDBC driver is used.
*Default: driver default*

&#128288;``connectionInitSql``<br/>
This property sets a SQL statement that will be executed after every new connection creation
before adding it to the pool. If this SQL is not valid or throws an exception, it will be
treated as a connection failure and the standard retry logic will be followed.
*Default: none*

&#128288;``driverClassName``<br/>
HikariCP will attempt to resolve a driver through the DriverManager based solely on the ``jdbcUrl``,
but for some older drivers the ``driverClassName`` must also be specified.  Omit this property unless
you get an obvious error message indicating that the driver was not found.
*Default: none*

&#128288;``transactionIsolation``<br/>
This property controls the default transaction isolation level of connections returned from
the pool.  If this property is not specified, the default transaction isolation level defined
by the JDBC driver is used.  Only use this property if you have specific isolation requirements that are
common for all queries.  The value of this property is the constant name from the ``Connection``
class such as ``TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED``, ``TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ``, etc.
*Default: driver default*

&#8986;``validationTimeout``<br/>
This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection will be tested for aliveness.
This value must be less than the ``connectionTimeout``.  Lowest acceptable validation timeout is 250 ms.
*Default: 5000*

&#8986;``leakDetectionThreshold``<br/>
This property controls the amount of time that a connection can be out of the pool before a
message is logged indicating a possible connection leak.  A value of 0 means leak detection
is disabled.  Lowest acceptable value for enabling leak detection is 2000 (2 seconds).
*Default: 0*

&#10145;``dataSource``<br/>
This property is only available via programmatic configuration or IoC container.  This property
allows you to directly set the instance of the ``DataSource`` to be wrapped by the pool, rather than
having HikariCP construct it via reflection.  This can be useful in some dependency injection
frameworks. When this property is specified, the ``dataSourceClassName`` property and all
DataSource-specific properties will be ignored.
*Default: none*

&#128288;``schema``<br/>
This property sets the default *schema* for databases that support the concept of schemas.
If this property is not specified, the default schema defined by the JDBC driver is used.
*Default: driver default*

&#10145;``threadFactory``<br/>
This property is only available via programmatic configuration or IoC container.  This property
allows you to set the instance of the ``java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory`` that will be used
for creating all threads used by the pool. It is needed in some restricted execution environments
where threads can only be created through a ``ThreadFactory`` provided by the application container.
*Default: none*

&#10145;``scheduledExecutor``<br/>
This property is only available via programmatic configuration or IoC container.  This property
allows you to set the instance of the ``java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService`` that will
be used for various internally scheduled tasks.  If supplying HikariCP with a ``ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor``
instance, it is recommended that ``setRemoveOnCancelPolicy(true)`` is used.
*Default: none*

----------------------------------------------------

#### Missing Knobs

HikariCP has plenty of ""knobs"" to turn as you can see above, but comparatively less than some other pools.
This is a design philosophy.  The HikariCP design aesthetic is Minimalism.  In keeping with the
*simple is better* or *less is more* design philosophy, some configuration axis are intentionally left out.

#### Statement Cache

Many connection pools, including Apache DBCP, Vibur, c3p0 and others offer ``PreparedStatement`` caching.
HikariCP does not.  Why?

At the connection pool layer ``PreparedStatements`` can only be cached *per connection*.  If your application
has 250 commonly executed queries and a pool of 20 connections you are asking your database to hold on to
5000 query execution plans -- and similarly the pool must cache this many ``PreparedStatements`` and their
related graph of objects.

Most major database JDBC drivers already have a Statement cache that can be configured, including PostgreSQL,
Oracle, Derby, MySQL, DB2, and many others.  JDBC drivers are in a unique position to exploit database specific
features, and nearly all of the caching implementations are capable of sharing execution plans *across connections*.
This means that instead of 5000 statements in memory and associated execution plans, your 250 commonly executed
queries result in exactly 250 execution plans in the database.  Clever implementations do not even retain
``PreparedStatement`` objects in memory at the driver-level but instead merely attach new instances to existing plan IDs.

Using a statement cache at the pooling layer is an [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern),
and will negatively impact your application performance compared to driver-provided caches.

#### Log Statement Text / Slow Query Logging

Like Statement caching, most major database vendors support statement logging through
properties of their own driver.  This includes Oracle, MySQL, Derby, MSSQL, and others.  Some
even support slow query logging.  For those few databases that do not support it, several options are available.
We have received [a report that p6spy works well](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/issues/57#issuecomment-354647631),
and also note the availability of [log4jdbc](https://github.com/arthurblake/log4jdbc) and [jdbcdslog-exp](https://code.google.com/p/jdbcdslog-exp/).

#### Rapid Recovery
Please read the [Rapid Recovery Guide](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/Rapid-Recovery) for details on how to configure your driver and system for proper recovery from database restart and network partition events.

----------------------------------------------------

### Initialization

You can use the ``HikariConfig`` class like so<sup>1</sup>:
```java
HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
config.setJdbcUrl(""jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/simpsons"");
config.setUsername(""bart"");
config.setPassword(""51mp50n"");
config.addDataSourceProperty(""cachePrepStmts"", ""true"");
config.addDataSourceProperty(""prepStmtCacheSize"", ""250"");
config.addDataSourceProperty(""prepStmtCacheSqlLimit"", ""2048"");

HikariDataSource ds = new HikariDataSource(config);
```
&nbsp;<sup><sup>1</sup> MySQL-specific example, DO NOT COPY VERBATIM.</sup>

or directly instantiate a ``HikariDataSource`` like so:
```java
HikariDataSource ds = new HikariDataSource();
ds.setJdbcUrl(""jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/simpsons"");
ds.setUsername(""bart"");
ds.setPassword(""51mp50n"");
...
```
or property file based:
```java
// Examines both filesystem and classpath for .properties file
HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig(""/some/path/hikari.properties"");
HikariDataSource ds = new HikariDataSource(config);
```
Example property file:
```ini
dataSourceClassName=org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource
dataSource.user=test
dataSource.password=test
dataSource.databaseName=mydb
dataSource.portNumber=5432
dataSource.serverName=localhost
```
or ``java.util.Properties`` based:
```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty(""dataSourceClassName"", ""org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource"");
props.setProperty(""dataSource.user"", ""test"");
props.setProperty(""dataSource.password"", ""test"");
props.setProperty(""dataSource.databaseName"", ""mydb"");
props.put(""dataSource.logWriter"", new PrintWriter(System.out));

HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig(props);
HikariDataSource ds = new HikariDataSource(config);
```

There is also a System property available, ``hikaricp.configurationFile``, that can be used to specify the
location of a properties file.  If you intend to use this option, construct a ``HikariConfig`` or ``HikariDataSource``
instance using the default constructor and the properties file will be loaded.

### Performance Tips
[MySQL Performance Tips](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/MySQL-Configuration)

### Popular DataSource Class Names

We recommended using ``dataSourceClassName`` instead of ``jdbcUrl``, but either is acceptable.  We'll say that again, *either is acceptable*.

&#9888;&nbsp;*Note: Spring Boot auto-configuration users, you need to use ``jdbcUrl``-based configuration.*

&#9888;&nbsp;The MySQL DataSource is known to be broken with respect to network timeout support. Use ``jdbcUrl`` configuration instead.

Here is a list of JDBC *DataSource* classes for popular databases:

| Database         | Driver       | *DataSource* class |
|:---------------- |:------------ |:-------------------|
| Apache Derby     | Derby        | org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDataSource |
| Firebird         | Jaybird      | org.firebirdsql.ds.FBSimpleDataSource |
| H2               | H2           | org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource |
| HSQLDB           | HSQLDB       | org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDataSource |
| IBM DB2          | IBM JCC      | com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2SimpleDataSource |
| IBM Informix     | IBM Informix | com.informix.jdbcx.IfxDataSource |
| MS SQL Server    | Microsoft    | com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDataSource |
| ~~MySQL~~        | Connector/J  | ~~com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource~~ |
| MariaDB          | MariaDB      | org.mariadb.jdbc.MariaDbDataSource |
| Oracle           | Oracle       | oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource |
| OrientDB         | OrientDB     | com.orientechnologies.orient.jdbc.OrientDataSource |
| PostgreSQL       | pgjdbc-ng    | com.impossibl.postgres.jdbc.PGDataSource |
| PostgreSQL       | PostgreSQL   | org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource |
| SAP MaxDB        | SAP          | com.sap.dbtech.jdbc.DriverSapDB |
| SQLite           | xerial       | org.sqlite.SQLiteDataSource |
| SyBase           | jConnect     | com.sybase.jdbc4.jdbc.SybDataSource |

### Play Framework Plugin

```

## Follow scroll

[![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/florent37/ExpectAnim/master/media/scroll.gif)](https://github.com/florent37/ExpectAnim)

Use `setPercent` to apply modify the current step of the animation

Exemple with a scrollview

```java
this.expectAnimMove = new ExpectAnim()
                .expect(username)
                .toBe(
                        toRightOf(avatar).withMarginDp(16),
                        sameCenterVerticalAs(avatar),
                        alpha(0.5f)
                )

                .expect(avatar)
                .toBe(
                        topOfParent(),
                        leftOfParent().withMarginDp(16),
                        scale(0.5f, 0.5f)
                )
                .expect(follow)
                .toBe(
                        rightOfParent().withMarginDp(16),
                        sameCenterVerticalAs(avatar)
                )

                .expect(backbground)
                .toBe(
                        height(height).withGravity(Gravity.LEFT|Gravity.START, Gravity.TOP)
                )

                .toAnimation();

scrollView.setOnScrollChangeListener(new NestedScrollView.OnScrollChangeListener() {
    @Override
    public void onScrollChange(NestedScrollView v, int scrollX, int scrollY, int oldScrollX, int oldScrollY) {
        final float percent = (scrollY * 1f) / v.getMaxScrollAmount();

        expectAnimMove.setPercent(percent);
    }
});
```

## Concat

You can play an anim after one other using `ExpectAnim.concat` (static method)

```
ExpectAnim.concat(
                new ExpectAnim()
                        .expect(image1)
                        .toBe(
                                withCameraDistance(500f),
                                flippedHorizontally()
                        )
                        .toAnimation()
                        .setDuration(1000),
                new ExpectAnim()
                        .expect(image2)
                        .toBe(
                                withCameraDistance(1000f),
                                flippedVertically()
                        )
                        .toAnimation()
                        .setDuration(500)
                )
                .start()
```

## Apply directly

Use `setNow` to apply directly the transformation

```java
new ExpectAnim()
                .expect(view)
                .toBe(
                        outOfScreen(Gravity.BOTTOM)
                )
                .toAnimation()
                .setNow();
```

## Reset

Use `reset` to return to the initial state of views

```java
expectAnim.reset():
```

# List of expectations

```
new ExpectAnim()
                .expect(view)
                .toBe(

                    //.withMargin(marginPx)
                    //.withMarginDp(margin)
                    //.withMarginDimen(R.dimen.margin)

                    toRightOf(view)
                    toLeftOf(view)
                    belowOf(view)
                    aboveOf(view)

                    atItsOriginalPosition()


                    sameCenterAs(view, horizontal, vertical)
                    sameCenterHorizontalAs(view)
                    sameCenterVerticalAs(view)
                    centerInParent(horizontal, vertical)
                    centerVerticalInParent()
                    centerHorizontalInParent()

                    centerBetweenViews(view1, view2, horizontal, vertical)
                    centerBetweenViewAndParent(otherView, horizontal, vertical, toBeOnRight, toBeOnBottom)

                    topOfParent()

### Change History
If you're interested in the change history of swagger and the Swagger Core framework, see [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/releases).

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* Java 8
* Apache maven 3.0.4 or greater
* Jackson 2.4.5 or greater


### To build from source (currently 2.0.10-SNAPSHOT)
```
# first time building locally
mvn -N
```

Subsequent builds:
```
mvn install
```

This will build the modules.

Of course if you don't want to build locally you can grab artifacts from maven central:

`http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/swagger/`

## Sample Apps
The samples have moved to [a new repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-samples/tree/2.0) and contain various integrations and configurations.

## Security contact

Please disclose any security-related issues or vulnerabilities by emailing [security@swagger.io](mailto:security@swagger.io), instead of using the public issue tracker.

<a name=""project0""/>___0 Java基础项目___
#### Java控制台显示界面。

###

  Java基础项目(商超购物管理系统)具有商品管理、前台收银、商品库存等功能，本项目使用java作为开发语言，
  `原生JDBC`连接Oracle数据库存储数据，可以有效地锻炼和加强开发者运用Java、oracle数据库及基本sql编程开发的能力。
  本项目适用于有Java、基本sql基础的开发者进行实战训练。(基础不错的同学可以直接学习 1# Java菜鸟项目 )

  另：后续项目均以其上级项目为雏形进行新知识的增添进行代码重构来达到新知识应用学习的目的。


<br><br>


<a name=""project1""/>___1 Java菜鸟项目___
#### JSP显示页面，模拟购物网站。

###

    时间断断续续...
    目前推送完成 注册、登陆、浏览商品、购物车、查询商品、退出 等模块。
    此项目雏形完成，后续改进细节。相对于 《0# Java基础项目》 本项目知识量较大，慢慢消化。
    后续：此项目不再进行更新维护，学习者学完此项目即可进入  《2：Java入门项目》
          通过这两个项目的锻炼，可以尝试找份实习啦。


<br><br>


<a name=""project2""/>___2 Java入门项目___
#### 改为mybatis连接数据库。

###

    此项目代码根据 Java菜鸟项目 重构而来。
    知识量逐步增大，本项目主要学习面向接口结合配置文件编程。
    与以上两个项目显然的不同是，代码相对规范，接近企业级的编程思想。
    利用周末空闲，逐渐推送中。。。
    
    后续：该项目重构完成，仅再改进细枝末节。
          小建议：以 表(Table) 为学习路径；Goods->Order->User.

          预：《3：Java狙击项目》继续以重构的方式学习新知识。
                需要学习者了解 maven、Spring MVC 等相关知识
                因已使用mybatis故Hibernate不再在此项目中涉及，
                两个者思想类似、职能相同，喜欢的同学可以自己研究重构。


<br><br>


<a name=""project3""/>___3 Java狙击项目___
#### 飞鸟速购

###

    该项目独立于上述项目存在。
 	此项目涉猎的知识更为广泛。
 	时间仍然很难连续起来，间断性推送中。。。
    
    开发工具：Eclipse + Oracle
    开发框架：shiro+spring+springMVc+mybatis
    另：jdk 1.8

## Data Structures
### Linked List
 * A *Linked List* is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each
   pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure
   consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
 * **Singly-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points to null
 * **Doubly-linked list**: linked list in which each node has two pointers, p and n, such that p points to the previous node and n points to the next node; the last node's n pointer points to null
 * **Circular-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points back to the first node
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Stack
 * A *Stack* is a collection of elements, with two principle operations: *push*, which adds to the collection, and
   *pop*, which removes the most recently added element
 * **Last in, first out data structure (LIFO)**: the most recently added object is the first to be removed
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Queue
 * A *Queue* is a collection of elements, supporting two principle operations: *enqueue*, which inserts an element
   into the queue, and *dequeue*, which removes an element from the queue
 * **First in, first out data structure (FIFO)**: the oldest added object is the first to be removed
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Tree
 * A *Tree* is an undirected, connected, acyclic graph

### Binary Tree
 * A *Binary Tree* is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as
   the *left child* and *right child*
 * **Full Tree**: a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children
 * **Perfect Binary Tree**: a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leave have the same depth
 * **Complete Tree**: a binary tree in which every level *except possibly the last* is full and all nodes in the last
   level are as far left as possible

### Binary Search Tree
 * A binary search tree, sometimes called BST, is a type of binary tree which maintains the property that the value in each
   node must be greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored
   in the right sub-tree
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(log(n))`
   * Search: `O(log(n))`
   * Insert: `O(log(n))`
   * Remove: `O(log(n))`

<img src=""/images/BST.png?raw=true"" alt=""Binary Search Tree"" width=""400"" height=""500"">

### Trie
* A trie, sometimes called a radix or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree that is used to store a dynamic set or associative
  array where the keys are usually Strings. No node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position 
  in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the String associated 
  with that node, and the root is associated with the empty String.

![Alt text](/images/trie.png?raw=true ""Trie"")

### Fenwick Tree
* A Fenwick tree, sometimes called a binary indexed tree, is a tree in concept, but in practice is implemented as an implicit data
  structure using an array. Given an index in the array representing a vertex, the index of a vertex's parent or child is calculated
  through bitwise operations on the binary representation of its index. Each element of the array contains the pre-calculated sum of
  a range of values, and by combining that sum with additional ranges encountered during an upward traversal to the root, the prefix
  sum is calculated
* Time Complexity:
  * Range Sum: `O(log(n))`
  * Update: `O(log(n))`

![Alt text](/images/fenwickTree.png?raw=true ""Fenwick Tree"")

### Segment Tree
* A Segment tree, is a tree data structure for storing intervals, or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain
  a given point
* Time Complexity:
  * Range Query: `O(log(n))`
  * Update: `O(log(n))`

![Alt text](/images/segmentTree.png?raw=true ""Segment Tree"")

### Heap
* A *Heap* is a specialized tree based structure data structure that satisfies the *heap* property: if A is a parent node of
B, then the key (the value) of node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B with the same ordering applying across the entire heap.
A heap can be classified further as either a ""max heap"" or a ""min heap"". In a max heap, the keys of parent nodes are always greater
than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node. In a min heap, the keys of parent nodes are less than
or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node
* Time Complexity:
  * Access Max / Min: `O(1)`
  * Insert: `O(log(n))`
  * Remove Max / Min: `O(log(n))`

<img src=""/images/heap.png?raw=true"" alt=""Max Heap"" width=""400"" height=""500"">


### Hashing
* *Hashing* is used to map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash
  function are called hash values, hash codes, or simply hashes. If two keys map to the same value, a collision occurs
* **Hash Map**: a *hash map* is a structure that can map keys to values. A hash map uses a hash function to compute
  an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
* Collision Resolution
 * **Separate Chaining**: in *separate chaining*, each bucket is independent, and contains a list of entries for each index. The
 time for hash map operations is the time to find the bucket (constant time), plus the time to iterate through the list
 * **Open Addressing**: in *open addressing*, when a new entry is inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the
 hashed-to-slot and proceeding in some sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. The name open addressing refers to
 the fact that the location of an item is not always determined by its hash value


![Alt text](/images/hash.png?raw=true ""Hashing"")

### Graph
* A *Graph* is an ordered pair of G = (V, E) comprising a set V of vertices or nodes together with a set E of edges or arcs,
  which are 2-element subsets of V (i.e. an edge is associated with two vertices, and that association takes the form of the
  unordered pair comprising those two vertices)
 * **Undirected Graph**: a graph in which the adjacency relation is symmetric. So if there exists an edge from node u to node
 v (u -> v), then it is also the case that there exists an edge from node v to node u (v -> u)
 * **Directed Graph**: a graph in which the adjacency relation is not symmetric. So if there exists an edge from node u to node v
 (u -> v), this does *not* imply that there exists an edge from node v to node u (v -> u)

## Algorithms

### Sorting

#### Quicksort
* Stable: `No`
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(nlog(n))`
  * Worst Case: `O(n^2)`
  * Average Case: `O(nlog(n))`

![Alt text](/images/quicksort.gif?raw=true ""Quicksort"")

#### Mergesort
* *Mergesort* is also a divide and conquer algorithm. It continuously divides an array into two halves, recurses on both the
  left subarray and right subarray and then merges the two sorted halves
* Stable: `Yes`
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(nlog(n))`
  * Worst Case: `O(nlog(n))`
  * Average Case: `O(nlog(n))`

![Alt text](/images/mergesort.gif?raw=true ""Mergesort"")

#### Bucket Sort
* *Bucket Sort* is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket
  is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `Ω(n + k)`
  * Worst Case: `O(n^2)`
  * Average Case:`Θ(n + k)`

![Alt text](/images/bucketsort.png?raw=true ""Bucket Sort"")

#### Radix Sort
* *Radix Sort* is a sorting algorithm that like bucket sort, distributes elements of an array into a number of buckets. However, radix
  sort differs from bucket sort by 're-bucketing' the array after the initial pass as opposed to sorting each bucket and merging
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `Ω(nk)`
  * Worst Case: `O(nk)`
  * Average Case: `Θ(nk)`

### Graph Algorithms

#### Depth First Search
* *Depth First Search* is a graph traversal algorithm which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
* Time Complexity: `O(|V| + |E|)`

![Alt text](/images/dfsbfs.gif?raw=true ""DFS / BFS Traversal"")

#### Breadth First Search
* *Breadth First Search* is a graph traversal algorithm which explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next
  level neighbors
* Time Complexity: `O(|V| + |E|)`

![Alt text](/images/dfsbfs.gif?raw=true ""DFS / BFS Traversal"")

#### Topological Sort
* *Topological Sort* is the linear ordering of a directed graph's nodes such that for every edge from node u to node v, u
  comes before v in the ordering
* Time Complexity: `O(|V| + |E|)`

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm
* *Dijkstra's Algorithm* is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph
* Time Complexity: `O(|V|^2)`

![Alt text](/images/dijkstra.gif?raw=true ""Dijkstra's"")

#### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
* *Bellman-Ford Algorithm* is an algorithm that computes the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph
* Although it is slower than Dijkstra's, it is more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are
  negative numbers
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(|E|)`
  * Worst Case: `O(|V||E|)`

![Alt text](/images/bellman-ford.gif?raw=true ""Bellman-Ford"")

#### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
* *Floyd-Warshall Algorithm* is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights, but
  no negative cycles
* A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between *all* pairs of nodes
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(|V|^3)`
  * Worst Case: `O(|V|^3)`
  * Average Case: `O(|V|^3)`

#### Prim's Algorithm
* *Prim's Algorithm* is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. In other words, Prim's find a
  subset of edges that forms a tree that includes every node in the graph
* Time Complexity: `O(|V|^2)`

![Alt text](/images/prim.gif?raw=true ""Prim's Algorithm"")

#### Kruskal's Algorithm
* *Kruskal's Algorithm* is also a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree in a graph. However, in Kruskal's, the graph does not
  have to be connected
* Time Complexity: `O(|E|log|V|)`

![Alt text](/images/kruskal.gif?raw=true ""Kruskal's Algorithm"")

## Greedy Algorithms
* *Greedy Algorithms* are algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of eventually reaching the globally optimal solution
* Problems must exhibit two properties in order to implement a Greedy solution:
 * Optimal Substructure
    * An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to the given problem's subproblems
 * The Greedy Property
    * An optimal solution is reached by ""greedily"" choosing the locally optimal choice without ever reconsidering previous choices
* Example - Coin Change
    * Given a target amount V cents and a list of denominations of n coins, i.e. we have coinValue[i] (in cents) for coin types i from [0...n - 1],
      what is the minimum number of coins that we must use to represent amount V? Assume that we have an unlimited supply of coins of any type
    * Coins - Penny (1 cent), Nickel (5 cents), Dime (10 cents), Quarter (25 cents)
    * Assume V = 41. We can use the Greedy algorithm of continuously selecting the largest coin denomination less than or equal to V, subtract that
      coin's value from V, and repeat.
    * V = 41 | 0 coins used
    * V = 16 | 1 coin used (41 - 25 = 16)
    * V = 6  | 2 coins used (16 - 10 = 6)
    * V = 1  | 3 coins used (6 - 5 = 1)
    * V = 0  | 4 coins used (1 - 1 = 0)
    * Using this algorithm, we arrive at a total of 4 coins which is optimal

## Bitmasks
* Bitmasking is a technique used to perform operations at the bit level. Leveraging bitmasks often leads to faster runtime complexity and
  helps limit memory usage
* Test kth bit: `s & (1 << k);`
* Set kth bit: `s |= (1 << k);`
* Turn off kth bit: `s &= ~(1 << k);`
* Toggle kth bit: `s ^= (1 << k);`
* Multiple by 2<sup>n</sup>: `s << n;`
* Divide by 2<sup>n</sup>: `s >> n;`
* Intersection: `s & t;`
* Union: `s | t;`
* Set Subtraction: `s & ~t;`
* Extract lowest set bit: `s & (-s);`
* Extract lowest unset bit: `~s & (s + 1);`
* Swap Values:
             ```
                x ^= y;
                y ^= x;
                x ^= y;
             ```

## Runtime Analysis

#### Big O Notation
* *Big O Notation* is used to describe the upper bound of a particular algorithm. Big O is used to describe worst case scenarios

![Alt text](/images/bigO.png?raw=true ""Theta Notation"")

#### Little O Notation
* *Little O Notation* is also used to describe an upper bound of a particular algorithm; however, Little O provides a bound
  that is not asymptotically tight

#### Big Ω Omega Notation
* *Big Omega Notation* is used to provide an asymptotic lower bound on a particular algorithm

![Alt text](/images/bigOmega.png?raw=true ""Theta Notation"")

#### Little ω Omega Notation
* *Little Omega Notation* is used to provide a lower bound on a particular algorithm that is not asymptotically tight

#### Theta Θ Notation
* *Theta Notation* is used to provide a bound on a particular algorithm such that it can be ""sandwiched"" between
  two constants (one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit) for sufficiently large values

========

A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.


Deprecated â€“ Please upgrade to Dagger 2
---------------------------------------

Square's Dagger 1.x is deprecated in favor of [Google's Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger).
Please see [the migration guide](https://google.github.io/dagger/dagger-1-migration.html) for help
with the upgrade.


Download Dagger 1
-----------------

You will need to include the `dagger-${dagger.version}.jar` in your
application's runtime.  In order to activate code generation you will need to
include `dagger-compiler-${dagger.version}.jar` in your build at compile time.

In a Maven project, one would include the runtime in the dependencies section
of your `pom.xml` (replacing `${dagger.version}` with the appropriate current
release), and the `dagger-compiler` artifact as an ""optional"" or ""provided""
dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>
    <version>${dagger.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>
    <version>${dagger.version}</version>
    <optional>true</optional>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

You can also find downloadable .jars on Maven Central. You'll need
[Dagger][dl-dagger], [JavaPoet][dl-javapoet], and [javax.inject][dl-inject].

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].

A simple convenience library for using a [HttpURLConnection](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html)
to make requests and access the response.

This library is available under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

## Usage

The http-request library is available from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.github.kevinsawicki%22%20AND%20a%3A%22http-request%22).

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.kevinsawicki</groupId>
  <artifactId>http-request</artifactId>
  <version>6.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Not using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)? Simply copy the [HttpRequest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinsawicki/http-request/master/lib/src/main/java/com/github/kevinsawicki/http/HttpRequest.java)
class into your project, update the package declaration, and you are good to go.

Javadocs are available [here](http://kevinsawicki.github.com/http-request/apidocs/index.html).

## FAQ

### Who uses this?

See [here](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/http-request/wiki/Used-By) for a
list of known projects using this library.

### Why was this written?

This library was written to make HTTP requests simple and easy when using a `HttpURLConnection`.

Libraries like [Apache HttpComponents](http://hc.apache.org) are great but sometimes
for either simplicity, or perhaps for the environment you are deploying to (Android),
you just want to use a good old-fashioned `HttpURLConnection`.  This library seeks
to add convenience and common patterns to the act of making HTTP requests such as
a fluid-interface for building requests and support for features such as multipart
requests.

**Bottom line:** The single goal of this library is to improve the usability of the
`HttpURLConnection` class.

### What are the dependencies?

**None**.  The goal of this library is to be a single class class with some inner static
classes.  The test project does require [Jetty](http://eclipse.org/jetty/) in order
to test requests against an actual HTTP server implementation.

### How are exceptions managed?

The `HttpRequest` class does not throw any checked exceptions, instead all low-level
exceptions are wrapped up in a `HttpRequestException` which extends `RuntimeException`.
You can access the underlying exception by catching `HttpRequestException` and calling
`getCause()` which will always return the original `IOException`.

### Are requests asynchronous?

**No**.  The underlying `HttpUrlConnection` object that each `HttpRequest`
object wraps has a synchronous API and therefore all methods on `HttpRequest`
are also synchronous.

Therefore it is important to not use an `HttpRequest` object on the main thread
of your application.

Here is a simple Android example of using it from an
[AsyncTask](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html):

```java
private class DownloadTask extends AsyncTask<String, Long, File> {
  protected File doInBackground(String... urls) {
    try {
      HttpRequest request =  HttpRequest.get(urls[0]);
      File file = null;
      if (request.ok()) {
        file = File.createTempFile(""download"", "".tmp"");
        request.receive(file);
        publishProgress(file.length());
      }
      return file;
    } catch (HttpRequestException exception) {
      return null;
    }
  }

  protected void onProgressUpdate(Long... progress) {
    Log.d(""MyApp"", ""Downloaded bytes: "" + progress[0]);
  }

  protected void onPostExecute(File file) {
    if (file != null)
      Log.d(""MyApp"", ""Downloaded file to: "" + file.getAbsolutePath());
    else
      Log.d(""MyApp"", ""Download failed"");
  }
}

new DownloadTask().execute(""http://google.com"");
```

## Examples

### Perform a GET request and get the status of the response

```java
int response = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"").code();
```

### Perform a GET request and get the body of the response

```java
String response = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"").body();
System.out.println(""Response was: "" + response);
```

### Print the response of a GET request to standard out

```java
HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"").receive(System.out);
```

### Adding query parameters

```java
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"", true, 'q', ""baseball gloves"", ""size"", 100);
System.out.println(request.toString()); // GET http://google.com?q=baseball%20gloves&size=100
```

### Using arrays as query parameters

```java
int[] ids = new int[] { 22, 23 };
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"", true, ""id"", ids);
System.out.println(request.toString()); // GET http://google.com?id[]=22&id[]=23
```

### Working with request/response headers

```java
String contentType = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"")
                                .accept(""application/json"") //Sets request header
                                .contentType(); //Gets response header
System.out.println(""Response content type was "" + contentType);
```

### Perform a POST request with some data and get the status of the response

```java
int response = HttpRequest.post(""http://google.com"").send(""name=kevin"").code();
```

### Authenticate using Basic authentication

```java
int response = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"").basic(""username"", ""p4ssw0rd"").code();
```

### Perform a multipart POST request

```java
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.post(""http://google.com"");
request.part(""status[body]"", ""Making a multipart request"");
request.part(""status[image]"", new File(""/home/kevin/Pictures/ide.png""));
if (request.ok())
  System.out.println(""Status was updated"");
```

### Perform a POST request with form data

```java
Map<String, String> data = new HashMap<String, String>();
data.put(""user"", ""A User"");
data.put(""state"", ""CA"");
if (HttpRequest.post(""http://google.com"").form(data).created())
  System.out.println(""User was created"");
```

### Copy body of response to a file

```java
File output = new File(""/output/request.out"");
HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"").receive(output);
```
### Post contents of a file

```java
File input = new File(""/input/data.txt"");
int response = HttpRequest.post(""http://google.com"").send(input).code();
```

### Using entity tags for caching

```java
File latest = new File(""/data/cache.json"");
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"");
//Copy response to file
request.receive(latest);
//Store eTag of response
String eTag = request.eTag();
//Later on check if changes exist
boolean unchanged = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"")
                               .ifNoneMatch(eTag)
                               .notModified();
```

### Using gzip compression

```java
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"");
//Tell server to gzip response and automatically uncompress
request.acceptGzipEncoding().uncompress(true);
String uncompressed = request.body();
System.out.println(""Uncompressed response is: "" + uncompressed);
```

### Ignoring security when using HTTPS

```java
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.get(""https://google.com"");
//Accept all certificates
request.trustAllCerts();
//Accept all hostnames
request.trustAllHosts();
```

### Configuring an HTTP proxy

```java
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.get(""https://google.com"");
//Configure proxy
request.useProxy(""localhost"", 8080);
//Optional proxy basic authentication
request.proxyBasic(""username"", ""p4ssw0rd"");
```

### Following redirects

```java
int code = HttpRequest.get(""http://google.com"").followRedirects(true).code();
```

### Custom connection factory

Looking to use this library with [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)?
Read [here](https://gist.github.com/JakeWharton/5797571).

```java
HttpRequest.setConnectionFactory(new ConnectionFactory() {

  public HttpURLConnection create(URL url) throws IOException {
    if (!""https"".equals(url.getProtocol()))
      throw new IOException(""Only secure requests are allowed"");
    return (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
  }

  public HttpURLConnection create(URL url, Proxy proxy) throws IOException {
    if (!""https"".equals(url.getProtocol()))
      throw new IOException(""Only secure requests are allowed"");
    return (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(proxy);
  }
});
```

Idea from: [iOS GPUImage framework](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage2)

Goal is to have something as similar to GPUImage as possible. Vertex and fragment shaders are exactly the same. That way it makes it easier to port filters from GPUImage iOS to Android.

## Requirements
* Android 2.2 or higher (OpenGL ES 2.0)

## Usage

### Gradle dependency

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'jp.co.cyberagent.android:gpuimage:2.x.x'
}
```

### Sample Code
#### With preview:

Java:
```java
@Override
public void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity);

    Uri imageUri = ...;
    gpuImage = new GPUImage(this);
    gpuImage.setGLSurfaceView((GLSurfaceView) findViewById(R.id.surfaceView));
    gpuImage.setImage(imageUri); // this loads image on the current thread, should be run in a thread
    gpuImage.setFilter(new GPUImageSepiaFilter());

    // Later when image should be saved saved:
    gpuImage.saveToPictures(""GPUImage"", ""ImageWithFilter.jpg"", null);
}
```

Kotlin:
```kotlin
public override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_gallery)

    val imageUri: Uri = ...
    gpuImage = GPUImage(this)
    gpuImage.setGLSurfaceView(findViewById<GLSurfaceView>(R.id.surfaceView))
    gpuImage.setImage(imageUri) // this loads image on the current thread, should be run in a thread
    gpuImage.setFilter(GPUImageSepiaFilter())

    // Later when image should be saved saved:
    gpuImage.saveToPictures(""GPUImage"", ""ImageWithFilter.jpg"", null)
}
```

#### Using GPUImageView
```xml
<jp.co.cyberagent.android.gpuimage.GPUImageView
    android:id=""@+id/gpuimageview""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    app:gpuimage_show_loading=""false""
    app:gpuimage_surface_type=""texture_view"" /> <!-- surface_view or texture_view -->
```

Java:
```java
@Override
public void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity);

    Uri imageUri = ...;
    gpuImageView = findViewById(R.id.gpuimageview);
    gpuImageView.setImage(imageUri); // this loads image on the current thread, should be run in a thread
    gpuImageView.setFilter(new GPUImageSepiaFilter());

    // Later when image should be saved saved:
    gpuImageView.saveToPictures(""GPUImage"", ""ImageWithFilter.jpg"", null);
}
```

Kotlin:
```kotlin
public override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_gallery)

    val imageUri: Uri = ...
    gpuImageView = findViewById<GPUImageView>(R.id.gpuimageview)
    gpuImageView.setImage(imageUri) // this loads image on the current thread, should be run in a thread
    gpuImageView.setFilter(GPUImageSepiaFilter())

    // Later when image should be saved saved:
    gpuImageView.saveToPictures(""GPUImage"", ""ImageWithFilter.jpg"", null)
}
```

#### Without preview:

Java:
```java
public void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    public void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    Uri imageUri = ...;
    gpuImage = new GPUImage(context);
    gpuImage.setFilter(new GPUImageSobelEdgeDetection());
    gpuImage.setImage(imageUri);
    gpuImage.saveToPictures(""GPUImage"", ""ImageWithFilter.jpg"", null);
}
```

Kotlin:
```kotlin
public override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_gallery)
    val imageUri: Uri = ...
    gpuImage = GPUImage(this)
    gpuImage.setFilter(GPUImageSepiaFilter())
    gpuImage.setImage(imageUri)
    gpuImage.saveToPictures(""GPUImage"", ""ImageWithFilter.jpg"", null)
}

Retrolambda: Use Lambdas on Java 7
==================================

[![Retrolambda presentation video](resources/presentation-preview.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdhfPh9V_s)

Just as there was *Retroweaver* et al. for running Java 5 code with
generics on Java 1.4, *Retrolambda* lets you run Java 8 code with **lambda
expressions**, **method references** and **try-with-resources statements**
on Java 7, 6 or 5. It does this by transforming your Java 8 compiled
bytecode so that it can run on an older Java runtime. After the
transformation they are just a bunch of normal .class files, without any
additional runtime dependencies.
[Read more details](#backported-language-features).

There is also [limited support](#known-limitations) for backporting
**default methods** and **static methods on interfaces**. This feature is
disabled by default.

Retrolambda supports backporting to Java 7, Java 6 and Java 5 runtimes. And
for adventurous developers there are [other backporting
tools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_backporting_tools) that may let
you go from Java 5 down to Java 1.4.

Android developers may use Retrolambda to take advantage of the Java 8
features on Android. Serge Zaitsev has written [an article about
it](http://zserge.com/blog/android-lambda.html) and there is a [Gradle
plugin](#gradle-plugin) which makes it easy.

Retrolambda does not backport the new Java 8 APIs, but there are other
projects that have backported some of them:

* [streamsupport](http://sourceforge.net/projects/streamsupport/) backports the `java.util.stream` API
* [ThreeTen](http://www.threeten.org/) backports the `java.time` API

Additionally [Animal Sniffer](http://www.mojohaus.org/animal-sniffer/) and 
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) can warn about the use of
Java 8 APIs.


User Guide
----------

Retrolambda can be run as a [Maven plugin](#maven-plugin),
[Gradle plugin](#gradle-plugin) or
[command line application](#command-line-application). Also have a look at
[some tips for using Retrolambda effectively](#tips).


### Maven Plugin

To run Retrolambda using Maven, add the following to your pom.xml:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>net.orfjackal.retrolambda</groupId>
    <artifactId>retrolambda-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.6</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>process-main</goal>
                <goal>process-test</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

See the [plugin documentation](https://luontola.github.io/retrolambda/retrolambda-maven-plugin/plugin-info.html)
for all possible parameters. There is also a usage example in [end-to-end-tests/pom.xml](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/blob/master/end-to-end-tests/pom.xml)


### Gradle Plugin

[Gradle Retrolamba Plugin](https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda) is developed by Evan Tatarka. See its site for usage instructions.


### Command Line Application

[Download](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/net/orfjackal/retrolambda/retrolambda/)
the latest `retrolambda.jar` from Maven Central.

Use JDK 8 to compile your source code.

Run Retrolambda, using Java 8, on the class files produced by JDK 8. Run
`java -jar retrolambda.jar` without any additional options to see the
instructions (for your convenience they are also shown below).

Your class files should now run on Java 7 or older.

```
Usage: java -Dretrolambda.inputDir=? -Dretrolambda.classpath=? [-javaagent:retrolambda.jar] -jar retrolambda.jar

Retrolambda takes Java 8 classes and backports lambda expressions and
some other language features to work on Java 7, 6 or 5.

Configurable system properties:

  retrolambda.bytecodeVersion
      Major version number for the generated bytecode. For a list, see
      offset 7 at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_class_file#General_layout
      Default value is 51 (i.e. Java 7)

  retrolambda.defaultMethods
      Whether to backport default methods and static methods on interfaces.
      LIMITATIONS: All backported interfaces and all classes which implement
      them or call their static methods must be backported together,
      with one execution of Retrolambda.
      Disabled by default. Enable by setting to ""true""

  retrolambda.inputDir (required)
      Input directory from where the original class files are read.

  retrolambda.outputDir
      Output directory into where the generated class files are written.
      Defaults to same as retrolambda.inputDir

  retrolambda.classpath (required)
      Classpath containing the original class files and their dependencies.
      Uses ; or : as the path separator, see java.io.File#pathSeparatorChar

  retrolambda.classpathFile (alternative)
      File listing the classpath entries.
      Alternative to retrolambda.classpath for avoiding the command line
      length limit. The file must list one file per line with UTF-8 encoding.

  retrolambda.includedFiles
      List of files to process, instead of processing all files.
      This is useful for a build tool to support incremental compilation.
      Uses ; or : as the path separator, see java.io.File#pathSeparatorChar

  retrolambda.includedFilesFile (alternative)
      File listing the files to process, instead of processing all files.
      Alternative to retrolambda.includedFiles for avoiding the command line
      length limit. The file must list one file per line with UTF-8 encoding.

  retrolambda.javacHacks
      Attempts to fix javac bugs (type-annotation emission for local variables).
      Disabled by default. Enable by setting to ""true""

  retrolambda.quiet
      Reduces the amount of logging.
      Disabled by default. Enable by setting to ""true""

If the Java agent is used, then Retrolambda will use it to capture the
lambda classes generated by Java. Otherwise Retrolambda will hook into
Java's internal lambda dumping API, which is more susceptible to suddenly
stopping to work between Java releases.
```


### Tips

Be sure to run comprehensive tests on your target JVM version (e.g. Java
7), in case the code accidentally uses Java 8 APIs or language features
that Retrolambda doesn't backport.

During development, inside an IDE, it's the easiest to use Java 8, without
Retrolamba, to compile and run tests. But in your continuous integration
and release builds you should run all tests using the target Java version.
For example, you can configure Maven Surefire Plugin to run tests
[using a different JVM](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#jvm).

I recommend setting up environment variables JAVA8_HOME, JAVA7_HOME etc. and
referring to those variables in the build configuration, instead of relying on
what happens to be the default Java version in JAVA_HOME.

You will need Java 8 for compiling and also for generating Javadocs.
JDK 7's Javadoc tool will fail for some valid Java 8 code.


Backported Language Features
----------------------------

**Lambda expressions** are backported by converting them to anonymous inner
classes. This includes the optimization of using a singleton instance for
stateless lambda expressions to avoid repeated object allocation.

**Method references** are basically just syntax sugar for lambda
expressions and they are backported in the same way.

**Try-with-resources statements** are backported by removing calls to
`Throwable.addSuppressed` if the target bytecode version is below Java 7.
If you would like the suppressed exceptions to be logged instead of
swallowed, please create a feature request and we'll make it configurable.

**Objects.requireNonNull calls** are replaced with calls to `Object.getClass`
if the target bytecode version is below Java 7. The synthetic null checks
generated by JDK 9 use `Objects.requireNonNull`, whereas earlier JDK versions
used `Object.getClass`.


*Optionally also:*

**Default methods** are backported by copying the default methods to a
companion class (interface name + ""$"") as static methods, replacing the
default methods in the interface with abstract methods, and by adding the
necessary method implementations to all classes which implement that
interface.

**Static methods on interfaces** are backported by moving the static
methods to a companion class (interface name + ""$""), and by changing all
methods calls to call the new method location.<sup>[1]</sup>

<sup>[1]</sup> *The static methods are moved to a companion class even with
default method support disabled, because some of them may be lambda
implementation methods, but the method calls to static methods are not
updated. This may cause weird error messages if static methods on
interfaces are accidentally used without enabling default method support.*


Known Limitations
-----------------

Does not backport Java 8 APIs.

Backporting default methods and static methods on interfaces requires all
backported interfaces and all classes which implement them or call their
static methods to be backported together, with one execution of
Retrolambda. In other words, you must *always do a clean build*. Also,
backporting default methods won't work across module or dependency
boundaries.

May break if a future JDK 8 build stops generating a new class for each
`invokedynamic` call. Retrolambda works so that it captures the bytecode
that `java.lang.invoke.LambdaMetafactory` generates dynamically, so
optimizations to that mechanism may break Retrolambda.

Java 9 and higher are not supported; just build your project with Java 8. The
new JDKs mostly just add new APIs, which you anyways wouldn't be able to use on
on older JREs. To backport new language features, create a new tool for it
yourself or pay someone to do it, if you think it's worth the effort. ;)

  as those included in the JRE, but which have different bytecode
  ([Issue #29](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/29))

### Retrolambda 1.6.0 (2014-08-20)

- Does not anymore require the use of a Java agent
  ([Issue #27](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/27))
- Maven plugin: by default run Retrolambda in the same process as Maven,
  making it a bit faster. If Maven is not running under Java 8, then will
  fall back to forking the process and using the Java agent mechanism

### Retrolambda 1.5.0 (2014-07-19)

- Maven plugin: use the [JDK from Maven Toolchains](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-toolchains-plugin/toolchains/jdk.html)
  if available. The `java8home` configuration parameter overrides this
  ([Issue #24](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/pull/24))

### Retrolambda 1.4.0 (2014-07-04)

- Added an optional `-Dretrolambda.includedFiles` parameter to support the
  incremental compilers of build tools
  ([Issue #23](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/pull/23))
- Decides which lambda classes to save based on the current class being
  processed, instead of the class loader that loaded the lambda class
  ([Issue #21](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/21))

### Retrolambda 1.3.0 (2014-06-04)

- Maven plugin: made the input and output directories configurable
  ([Issue #20](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/20))
- Maven plugin: by default use the current JRE for running Retrolambda.
  For the old behavior, add `<java8home>${env.JAVA8_HOME}</java8home>`
  to the plugin configuration

### Retrolambda 1.2.3 (2014-05-19)

- Android: Fixed NoSuchMethodError when calling a private method to which
  there is a method reference
  ([Issue #18](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/18))
- Fixed the possibility of accidentally overriding private methods to which
  there is method reference
  ([Issue #19](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/19))

### Retrolambda 1.2.2 (2014-05-15)

- Fixed method references to private methods; will now make them
  package-private the same way as lambda implementation methods
  ([Issue #17](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/17))

### Retrolambda 1.2.1 (2014-05-04)

- Fixed the Retrolambda Maven plugin not using the project's classpath
  ([Issue #16](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/16))
- Maven plugin: save `retrolambda.jar` under `target/retrolambda/`
- Suppress false warning about class initializer methods on interfaces

### Retrolambda 1.2.0 (2014-05-02)

- Maven plugin for running Retrolambda
  (thanks, [Dave Moten](https://github.com/davidmoten))

### Retrolambda 1.1.4 (2014-03-29)

- Removes from interfaces bridge methods which were generated by JDK 8 e.g.
  when an interface overrides a method and refines its return type
  ([Issue #13](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/13))

### Retrolambda 1.1.3 (2014-03-25)

- Fixed incompatibility with the Eclipse JDT compiler, version Kepler SR2
  with the Java 8 support patch 1.0.0.v20140317-1959
  ([Issue #12](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/12))

### Retrolambda 1.1.2 (2014-01-08)

- Updated to work with JDK 8 Early Access Build b121 (2013-12-19)
  ([Issue #3](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/3))

### Retrolambda 1.1.1 (2013-11-27)

- Show help if the `-javaagent` parameter is missing
  ([Issue #2](https://github.com/luontola/retrolambda/issues/2))

### Retrolambda 1.1.0 (2013-07-25)

- Create only one instance of lambdas which do not capture arguments; i.e.
  the same optimization as what JDK 8 does
- Start the sequence number of lambda classes from one (e.g.
  `com.example.Foo$$Lambda$1`) for each enclosing class

### Retrolambda 1.0.0 (2013-07-23)

- Backports lambda expressions and method references to Java 7 and older
- Tested to work with JDK 8 Early Access Build b99 (2013-07-19)

This repository contains a barebones WebSocket server and client implementation
written in 100% Java. The underlying classes are implemented `java.nio`, which allows for a
non-blocking event-driven model (similar to the
[WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/) for web browsers).

Implemented WebSocket protocol versions are:

 * [RFC 6455](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)

[Here](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/wiki/Drafts) some more details about protocol versions/drafts. 


## Getting Started

### Dependency management tools

Below is a brief guide to using dependency management tools like maven or gradle.

#### Maven
To use maven add this dependency to your pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.java-websocket</groupId>
  <artifactId>Java-WebSocket</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle
To use Gradle add the maven central repository to your repositories list:
```xml
mavenCentral()
```
Then you can just add the latest version to your build.
```xml
compile ""org.java-websocket:Java-WebSocket:1.4.0""
```

#### Logging

This library uses [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) for logging and does not ship with any default logging implementation.

Exceptions are using the log level `ERROR` and debug logging will be done with log level `TRACE`.

Feel free to use whichever logging framework you desire and use the corresponding [binding](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j) in your dependency management.

If you want to get started, take a look at the SimpleLogger [example](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/wiki/SimpleLogger-example).

### Standalone jar

If you do not use any dependency management tool, you can find the latest standalone jar [here](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/releases/latest).

Writing your own WebSocket Server
---------------------------------

The `org.java_websocket.server.WebSocketServer` abstract class implements the
server-side of the
[WebSocket Protocol](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-socket-protocol/).
A WebSocket server by itself doesn't do anything except establish socket
connections though HTTP. After that it's up to **your** subclass to add purpose.

An example for a WebSocketServer can be found in both the [wiki](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/wiki#server-example) and the [example](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/tree/master/src/main/example) folder.

Writing your own WebSocket Client
---------------------------------

The `org.java_websocket.client.WebSocketClient` abstract class can connect to
valid WebSocket servers. The constructor expects a valid `ws://` URI to
connect to. Important events `onOpen`, `onClose`, `onMessage` and `onError`
get fired throughout the life of the WebSocketClient, and must be implemented 
in **your** subclass.

An example for a WebSocketClient can be found in both the [wiki](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/wiki#client-example) and the [example](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/tree/master/src/main/example) folder.

Examples
-------------------
 
You can find a lot of examples [here](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/tree/master/src/main/example).

WSS Support
---------------------------------
This library supports wss.
To see how to use wss please take a look at the examples.<br>

If you do not have a valid **certificate** in place then you will have to create a self signed one.
Browsers will simply refuse the connection in case of a bad certificate and will not ask the user to accept it.
So the first step will be to make a browser to accept your self signed certificate. ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=594502 ).<br>
If the websocket server url is `wss://localhost:8000` visit the url `https://localhost:8000` with your browser. The browser will recognize the handshake and allow you to accept the certificate. This technique is also demonstrated in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8lBdfAZPkU).

The vm option `-Djavax.net.debug=all` can help to find out if there is a problem with the certificate.

It is currently not possible to accept ws and wss connections at the same time via the same websocket server instance.

For some reason Firefox does not allow multiple connections to the same wss server if the server uses a different port than the default port (443).


If you want to use `wss` on the android platfrom you should take a look at [this](http://blog.antoine.li/2010/10/22/android-trusting-ssl-certificates/).

I ( @Davidiusdadi ) would be glad if you would give some feedback whether wss is working fine for you or not.

Minimum Required JDK
--------------------

`Java-WebSocket` is known to work with:

 * Java 1.6 and higher
 * Android 4.0 and higher

Other JRE implementations may work as well, but haven't been tested.

1.2.x 源码分支：https://github.com/changmingxie/tcc-transaction/tree/master-1.2.x

1.2.x 版本不向下兼容1.1.x，主要在声明tcc服务方法的注解有改变。1.2.x不同于1.1.x主要的地方在于发布服务时不再强制要求服务方法参数必须有TransactionContext参数，从而减少对业务代码的侵入。



Try: 尝试执行业务

    完成所有业务检查（一致性）

    预留必须业务资源（准隔离性）

Confirm: 确认执行业务

    真正执行业务

    不作任何业务检查

    只使用Try阶段预留的业务资源

    Confirm操作满足幂等性

Cancel: 取消执行业务

    释放Try阶段预留的业务资源

    Cancel操作满足幂等性


示例说明:

tcc-transaction不和底层使用的rpc框架耦合，也就是使用doubbo,thrift,web service,http等都可。tcc-transaction-http-sample示例演示了不依赖底层rpc框架情况下如何使用tcc-transaction。

在底层rpc框架为dubbo情况下，可利用tcc-trnansaction-dubbo jar提供的便利，方便应用使用tcc-transaction。tcc-transaction-dubbo-sample示例演示了在使用dubbo作为rpc调用情况下如何使用tcc-transaction。

示例演示在下完订单后,使用红包帐户和资金帐户来付款，红包帐户服务和资金帐户服务在不同的系统中。示例中，有两个SOA提供方，一个是CapitalTradeOrderService，代表着资金帐户服务,另一个是RedPacketTradeOrderService,代表着红包帐户服务。

下完订单后，订单状态为DRAFT，在TCC事务中TRY阶段，订单支付服务将订单状态变成PAYING，同时远程调用红包帐户服务和资金帐户服务,将付款方的余额减掉（预留业务资源);如果在TRY阶段，任何一个服务失败，tcc-transaction将自动调用这些服务对应的cancel方法，订单支付服务将订单状态变成PAY_FAILED,同时远程调用红包帐户服务和资金帐户服务,将付款方余额减掉的部分增加回去；如果TRY阶段正常完成，则进入CONFIRM阶段，在CONFIRM阶段（tcc-transaction自动调用）,订单支付服务将订单状态变成CONFIRMED,同时远程调用红包帐户服务和资金帐户服务对应的CONFIRM方法，将收款方的余额增加。特别说明下，由于是示例，在CONFIRM和CANCEL方法中没有实现幂等性，如果在真实项目中使用，需要保证CONFIRM和CANCEL方法的幂等性。

在运行sample前，需搭建好db环境，运行dbscripts目录下的create_db.sql建立数据库实例及表；还需修改各种项目中jdbc.properties文件中的jdbc连接信息。

**3. Mal is a learning tool**

Each implementation of mal is separated into
11 incremental, self-contained (and testable) steps that demonstrate
core concepts of Lisp. The last step is capable of self-hosting
(running the mal implementation of mal). See the [make-a-lisp process
guide](process/guide.md). 

The make-a-lisp steps are:

* [step0_repl](process/guide.md#step0)
* [step1_read_print](process/guide.md#step1)
* [step2_eval](process/guide.md#step2)
* [step3_env](process/guide.md#step3)
* [step4_if_fn_do](process/guide.md#step4)
* [step5_tco](process/guide.md#step5)
* [step6_file](process/guide.md#step6)
* [step7_quote](process/guide.md#step7)
* [step8_macros](process/guide.md#step8)
* [step9_try](process/guide.md#step9)
* [stepA_mal](process/guide.md#stepA)

Each make-a-lisp step has an associated architectural diagram. That elements
that are new for that step are highlighted in red.
Here is the final diagram for [step A](process/guide.md#stepA):

![stepA_mal architecture](process/stepA_mal.png)

If you are interested in creating a mal implementation (or just
interested in using mal for something), please drop by the #mal
channel on freenode. In addition to the [make-a-lisp process
guide](process/guide.md) there is also a [mal/make-a-lisp
FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) where I attempt to answer some common questions.


## Presentations

Mal was presented publicly for the first time in a lightning talk at
Clojure West 2014 (unfortunately there is no video). See
examples/clojurewest2014.mal for the presentation that was given at the
conference (yes, the presentation is a mal program).

At Midwest.io 2015, Joel Martin gave a presentation on Mal titled
""Achievement Unlocked: A Better Path to Language Learning"".
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgyOAiRtZGw),
[Slides](http://kanaka.github.io/midwest.io.mal/).

More recently Joel gave a presentation on ""Make Your Own Lisp Interpreter
in 10 Incremental Steps"" at LambdaConf 2016:
[Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhupfthTEk),
[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5OQBMGpaTU),
[Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mARZzGgX4U),
[Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCO1SYR5kDU),
[Slides](http://kanaka.github.io/lambdaconf/).

## Building/running implementations

The simplest way to run any given implementation is to use docker.
Every implementation has a docker image pre-built with language
dependencies installed. You can launch the REPL using a convenient
target in the top level Makefile (where IMPL is the implementation
directory name and stepX is the step to run):

```
make DOCKERIZE=1 ""repl^IMPL^stepX""
    # OR stepA is the default step:
make DOCKERIZE=1 ""repl^IMPL""
```

## External Implementations

The following implementations are maintained as separate projects:

### HolyC

* [by Alexander Bagnalla](https://github.com/bagnalla/holyc_mal)

### Rust

* [by Tim Morgan](https://github.com/seven1m/mal-rust)
* [by vi](https://github.com/vi/mal-rust-vi) - using [Pest](https://pest.rs/) grammar, not using typical Mal infrastructure (cargo-ized steps and built-in converted tests).


## Other mal Projects

 * [malc](https://github.com/dubek/malc) - Mal (Make A Lisp) compiler. Compiles a Mal program to LLVM assembly language, then binary.
 * [malcc](https://git.sr.ht/~tim/malcc) (@seven1m) - malcc is an incremental compiler implementation for the Mal language. It uses the Tiny C Compiler as the compiler backend and has full support for the Mal language, including macros, tail-call elimination, and even run-time eval. [""I Built a Lisp Compiler""](https://mpov.timmorgan.org/i-built-a-lisp-compiler/) post about the process.
 * [frock](https://github.com/chr15m/frock) - Clojure-flavoured PHP. Uses mal/php to run programs.


## Implementation Details

### Ada

The Ada implementation was developed with GNAT 4.9 on debian. It also
compiles unchanged on windows if you have windows versions of git,
GNAT and (optionally) make.  There are no external dependencies
(readline not implemented).

```
cd ada
make
./stepX_YYY
```

### Ada.2

The second Ada implementation was developed with GNAT 8 and links with
the GNU readline library.

```
cd ada
make
./stepX_YYY
```

### GNU awk

The GNU awk implementation of mal has been tested with GNU awk 4.1.1.

```
cd gawk
gawk -O -f stepX_YYY.awk
```

### Bash 4

```
cd bash
bash stepX_YYY.sh
```

### BASIC (C64 and QBasic)

The BASIC implementation uses a preprocessor that can generate BASIC
code that is compatible with both C64 BASIC (CBM v2) and QBasic. The
C64 mode has been tested with
[cbmbasic](https://github.com/kanaka/cbmbasic) (the patched version is
currently required to fix issues with line input) and the QBasic mode
has been tested with [qb64](http://www.qb64.net/).

Generate C64 code and run it using cbmbasic:

```
cd basic
make stepX_YYY.bas
STEP=stepX_YYY ./run
```

Generate QBasic code and load it into qb64:

```
cd basic
make MODE=qbasic stepX_YYY.bas
./qb64 stepX_YYY.bas
```

Thanks to [Steven Syrek](https://github.com/sjsyrek) for the original
inspiration for this implementation.

### BBC BASIC V

The BBC BASIC V implementation can run in the Brandy interpreter:

```
cd bbc-basic

### PL/pgSQL (PostgreSQL SQL Procedural Language)

The PL/pgSQL implementation of mal requires a running PostgreSQL server
(the ""kanaka/mal-test-plpgsql"" docker image automatically starts
a PostgreSQL server). The implementation connects to the PostgreSQL server
and create a database named ""mal"" to store tables and stored
procedures. The wrapper script uses the psql command to connect to the
server and defaults to the user ""postgres"" but this can be overridden
with the PSQL_USER environment variable. A password can be specified
using the PGPASSWORD environment variable. The implementation has been
tested with PostgreSQL 9.4.

```
cd plpgsql
./wrap.sh stepX_YYY.sql
    # OR
PSQL_USER=myuser PGPASSWORD=mypass ./wrap.sh stepX_YYY.sql
```

### PL/SQL (Oracle SQL Procedural Language)

The PL/SQL implementation of mal requires a running Oracle DB
server (the ""kanaka/mal-test-plsql"" docker image automatically

Oracle server to create types, tables and stored procedures. The
default SQL\\*Plus logon value (username/password@connect_identifier) is
""system/oracle"" but this can be overridden with the ORACLE_LOGON
environment variable. The implementation has been tested with Oracle
Express Edition 11g Release 2. Note that any SQL\\*Plus connection
warnings (user password expiration, etc) will interfere with the
ability of the wrapper script to communicate with the DB.

```
cd plsql
./wrap.sh stepX_YYY.sql
    # OR
ORACLE_LOGON=myuser/mypass@ORCL ./wrap.sh stepX_YYY.sql
```

### PostScript Level 2/3

### Yorick

The Yorick implementation of mal was tested on Yorick 2.2.04.

```
cd yorick
yorick -batch ./stepX_YYY.i
```



## Running tests

The top level Makefile has a number of useful targets to assist with
implementation development and testing. The `help` target provides
a list of the targets and options:

```
make help
```

### Functional tests

The are almost 800 generic functional tests (for all implementations)
in the `tests/` directory. Each step has a corresponding test file
containing tests specific to that step. The `runtest.py` test harness
launches a Mal step implementation and then feeds the tests one at
a time to the implementation and compares the output/return value to
the expected output/return value.

* To run all the tests across all implementations (be prepared to wait):

```
make test
```

* To run all tests against a single implementation:

```
make ""test^IMPL""

# e.g.
make ""test^clojure""
make ""test^js""
```

* To run tests for a single step against all implementations:

```
make ""test^stepX""

# e.g.
make ""test^step2""
make ""test^step7""
```

* To run tests for a specific step against a single implementation:

```
make ""test^IMPL^stepX""

# e.g
make ""test^ruby^step3""
make ""test^ps^step4""
```

### Self-hosted functional tests

* To run the functional tests in self-hosted mode, you specify `mal`
  as the test implementation and use the `MAL_IMPL` make variable
  to change the underlying host language (default is JavaScript):
```
make MAL_IMPL=IMPL ""test^mal^step2""

# e.g.
make ""test^mal^step2""   # js is default
make MAL_IMPL=ruby ""test^mal^step2""
make MAL_IMPL=python ""test^mal^step2""
```

### Starting the REPL

* To start the REPL of an implementation in a specific step:

```
make ""repl^IMPL^stepX""

# e.g
make ""repl^ruby^step3""
make ""repl^ps^step4""
```

* If you omit the step, then `stepA` is used:

```
make ""repl^IMPL""

# e.g
make ""repl^ruby""
make ""repl^ps""
```

* To start the REPL of the self-hosted implementation, specify `mal` as the
  REPL implementation and use the `MAL_IMPL` make variable to change the
  underlying host language (default is JavaScript):
```
make MAL_IMPL=IMPL ""repl^mal^stepX""

# e.g.
make ""repl^mal^step2""   # js is default
make MAL_IMPL=ruby ""repl^mal^step2""
make MAL_IMPL=python ""repl^mal""
```

### Performance tests

Warning: These performance tests are neither statistically valid nor
comprehensive; runtime performance is a not a primary goal of mal. If
you draw any serious conclusions from these performance tests, then
please contact me about some amazing oceanfront property in Kansas
that I'm willing to sell you for cheap.

* To run performance tests against a single implementation:
```
make ""perf^IMPL""

# e.g.
make ""perf^js""
```

* To run performance tests against all implementations:
```
make ""perf""
```

### Generating language statistics

* To report line and byte statistics for a single implementation:
```
make ""stats^IMPL""

# e.g.
make ""stats^js""
```

## Dockerized testing

Every implementation directory contains a Dockerfile to create
a docker image containing all the dependencies for that
implementation. In addition, the top-level Makefile contains support
for running the tests target (and perf, stats, repl, etc) within
a docker container for that implementation by passing *""DOCKERIZE=1""*
on the make command line. For example:

```
make DOCKERIZE=1 ""test^js^step3""
```

Existing implementations already have docker images built and pushed
to the docker registry. However, if
you wish to build or rebuild a docker image locally, the toplevel
Makefile provides a rule for building docker images:

```
make ""docker-build^IMPL""
```


**Notes**:
* Docker images are named *""kanaka/mal-test-IMPL""*
* JVM-based language implementations (Groovy, Java, Clojure, Scala):
  you will probably need to run this command once manually
  first `make DOCKERIZE=1 ""repl^IMPL""` before you can run tests because
  runtime dependencies need to be downloaded to avoid the tests timing
  out. These dependencies are downloaded to dot-files in the /mal
  directory so they will persist between runs.

## Generic Android Deobfuscator

Simplify virtually executes an app to understand its behavior and then tries to optimize the code so that it behaves identically but is easier for a human to understand. Each optimization type is simple and generic, so it doesn't matter what the specific type of obfuscation is used.

### Before and After

The code on the left is a decompilation of an obfuscated app, and the code on the right has been deobfuscated.

## Overview

There are three parts to the project: smalivm, simplify, and the demo app.

1. **smalivm**: Provides a virtual machine sandbox for executing Dalvik methods. After executing a method, it returns a graph containing all possible register and class values for every execution path. It works even if some values are unknown, such as file and network I/O. For example, any `if` or `switch` conditional with an unknown value results in both branches being taken.
2. **simplify**: Analyzes the execution graphs from **smalivm** and applies optimizations such as constant propagation, dead code removal, unreflection, and some peephole optimizations. These are fairly simple, but when applied together repeatedly, they'll decrypt strings, remove reflection, and greatly simplify code. It does *not* rename methods and classes.
3. **demoapp**: Contains simple, heavily commented examples for using **smalivm** in your own project. If you're building something that needs to execute Dalvik code, check it out.

```

## Building

Building requires the [Java Development Kit 8 (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) to be installed.

Because this project contains submodules for Android frameworks, either clone with `--recursive`:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/CalebFenton/simplify.git
```

Or update submodules at any time with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then, to build a single jar which contains all dependencies:

```bash
./gradlew fatjar
```

The Simplify jar will be in `simplify/build/libs/`. You can test it's working by simplifying the provided [obfuscated example app](/simplify/ObfuscatedApp). Here's how you'd run it (you may need to change `simplify.jar`):

```bash
java -jar simplify/build/libs/simplify.jar -it 'org/cf/obfuscated' -et 'MainActivity' simplify/obfuscated-app.apk
```

To understand what's getting deobfuscated, check out [Obfuscated App's README](/simplify/ObfuscatedApp/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

If Simplify fails, try these recommendations, in order:

1. Only target a few methods or classes by using `-it` option.
2. If failure is because of maximum visits exceeded, try using higher `--max-address-visits`, `--max-call-depth`, and `--max-method-visits`.
3. Try with `-v` or `-v 2` and report the issue with the logs and a hash of the DEX or APK.
4. Try again, but do not break eye contact. Simplify can sense fear.

If building on Windows, and building fails with an error similar to:

> Could not find tools.jar. Please check that C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_151 contains a valid JDK installation.

This means Gradle is unable to find a proper JDK path. Make sure the JDK is installed, set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK path, and make sure to close and re-open the command prompt you use to build.

## Contributing

Don't be shy. I think virtual execution and deobfuscation are fascinating problems. Anyone who's interested is automatically cool and contributions are welcome, even if it's just to fix a typo. Feel free to ask questions in the issues and submit pull requests.

### Reporting Issues

Please include a link to the APK or DEX and the full command you're using. This makes it much easier to reproduce (and thus _fix_) your issue.

If you can't share the sample, *please* include the file hash (SHA1, SHA256, etc).

## Optimization Strategies

### Constant Propagation

If an op places a value of a type which can be turned into a constant such as a string, number, or boolean, this optimization will replace that op with the constant. For example:

```smali
const-string v0, ""VGVsbCBtZSBvZiB5b3VyIGhvbWV3b3JsZCwgVXN1bC4=""
invoke-static {v0}, Lmy/string/Decryptor;->decrypt(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;
# Decrypts to: ""Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.""
move-result v0
```

In this example, an encrypted string is decrypted and placed into `v0`. Since strings are ""constantizable"", the `move-result v0` can be replaced with a `const-string`:

```smali
const-string v0, ""VGVsbCBtZSBvZiB5b3VyIGhvbWV3b3JsZCwgVXN1bC4=""
invoke-static {v0}, Lmy/string/Decryptor;->decrypt(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;
const-string v0, ""Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.""
```

### Dead Code Removal

Code is dead if removing it cannot possibly alter the behavior of the app. The most obvious case is if the code is unreachable, e.g. `if (false) { // dead }`). If code is reachable, it may be considered dead if it doesn't affect any state outside of the method, i.e. it has no _side effect_. For example, code may not affect the return value for the method, alter any class variables, or perform any IO. This is a difficult to determine in static analysis. Luckily, smalivm doesn't have to be clever. It just stupidly executes everything it can and assumes there are side effects if it can't be sure. Consider the example from Constant Propagation:

```smali
const-string v0, ""VGVsbCBtZSBvZiB5b3VyIGhvbWV3b3JsZCwgVXN1bC4=""
invoke-static {v0}, Lmy/string/Decryptor;->decrypt(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;
const-string v0, ""Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.""
```

In this code, the `invoke-static` no longer affects the return value of the method and let's assume it doesn't do anything weird like write bytes to the file system or a network socket so it has no side effects. It can simply be removed.

```smali
const-string v0, ""VGVsbCBtZSBvZiB5b3VyIGhvbWV3b3JsZCwgVXN1bC4=""
const-string v0, ""Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.""
```

Finally, the first `const-string` assigns a value to a register, but that value is never used, i.e. the assignment is dead. It can also be removed.

```smali
const-string v0, ""Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.""
```

Huzzah!

### Unreflection

One major challenge with static analysis of Java is reflection. It's just not possible to know the arguments are for reflection methods without doing careful data flow analysis. There are smart, clever ways of doing this, but smalivm does it by just executing the code. When it finds a reflected method invocation such as:

```smali
invoke-virtual {v0, v1, v2}, Ljava/lang/reflect/Method;->invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
```

It can know the values of `v0`, `v1`, and `v2`. If it's sure what the values are, it can replace the call to `Method.invoke()` with an actual non-reflected method invocation. The same applies for reflected field and class lookups.

### Peephole

For everything that doesn't fit cleanly into a particular category, there's peephole optimizations. This includes removing useless `check-cast` ops, replacing `Ljava/lang/String;-><init>` calls with `const-string`, and so on.

## Deobfuscation Example

### Before Optimization

```smali
.method public static test1()I
    .locals 2

    new-instance v0, Ljava/lang/Integer;
    const/4 v1, 0x1
    invoke-direct {v0, v1}, Ljava/lang/Integer;-><init>(I)V

    invoke-virtual {v0}, Ljava/lang/Integer;->intValue()I
    move-result v0

    return v0
.end method
```

All this does is `v0 = 1`.

### After Constant Propagation

```smali
.method public static test1()I
    .locals 2

    new-instance v0, Ljava/lang/Integer;
    const/4 v1, 0x1
    invoke-direct {v0, v1}, Ljava/lang/Integer;-><init>(I)V

    invoke-virtual {v0}, Ljava/lang/Integer;->intValue()I
    const/4 v0, 0x1

    return v0
.end method
```

The `move-result v0` is replaced with `const/4 v0, 0x1`. This is because there is only one possible return value for `intValue()I` and the return type can be made a constant. The arguments `v0` and `v1` are unambiguous and do not change. That is to say, there's a consensus of values for every possible execution path at `intValue()I`. Other types of values that can be turned into constants:

* numbers - `const/4`, `const/16`, etc.
* strings - `const-string`
* classes - `const-class`

### After Dead Code Removal

```smali
.method public static test1()I
    .locals 2

    const/4 v0, 0x1

    return v0
.end method
```

Because the code above `const/4 v0, 0x1` does not affect state outside of the method (no side-effects), it can be removed without changing behavior. If there was a method call that wrote something to the file system or network, it couldn't be removed because it affects state outside the method. Or if `test()I` took a mutable argument, such as a `LinkedList`, any instructions that accessed it couldn't be considered dead.

Other examples of dead code:

* unreferenced assignments - assigning registers and not using them
* unreached / unreachable instructions - `if (false) { dead_code(); }`

[arrow.apache.org](https://arrow.apache.org).

## What's in the Arrow libraries?

The reference Arrow libraries contain a number of distinct software components:

- Columnar vector and table-like containers (similar to data frames) supporting
  flat or nested types
- Fast, language agnostic metadata messaging layer (using Google's Flatbuffers
  library)
- Reference-counted off-heap buffer memory management, for zero-copy memory
  sharing and handling memory-mapped files
- IO interfaces to local and remote filesystems
- Self-describing binary wire formats (streaming and batch/file-like) for
  remote procedure calls (RPC) and
  interprocess communication (IPC)
- Integration tests for verifying binary compatibility between the
  implementations (e.g. sending data from Java to C++)
- Conversions to and from other in-memory data structures

## Support Policy
AutoRest is an open source tool -- if you need assistance, first check the documentation. If you find a bug or need some help, feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues)


**AutoRest will release a stable version on the second Wednesday of the month.**

Using `npm` you can upgrade to the latest stable version of AutoRest:

---

# Installing AutoRest 

Installing AutoRest on Windows, MacOS or Linux involves two steps:

1. __Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)__ (10.15.x LTS HIGHLY RECOMENDED)
> for more help, check out [Installing Node.JS on different platforms](./docs/developer/workstation.md#nodejs)

2. __Install AutoRest__ using `npm`

  ``` powershell
  # Depending on your configuration you may need to be elevated or root to run this. (on OSX/Linux use 'sudo' )
  npm install -g autorest
  ```

### Updating AutoRest
  To update AutoRest if you have previous versions installed, please run:
    
  ``` powershell
  autorest --latest
  ``` 
or 
  ```powershell
  # Removes all other versions and installs the latest
  autorest --reset
  ```
  For more information, run  `autorest --help`


### Supported Platforms

While AutoRest itself runs on NodeJS, some generators use the .NET Core 2.0 runtime, which is the most limiting factor.
See [dotnet/core/release-notes/2.0/2.0-supported-os.md](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.0/2.0-supported-os.md) for a list of supported platforms.

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/READMEs/NullAway-README.md,"## NullAway: Fast Annotation-Based Null Checking for Java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/uber/NullAway.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/uber/NullAway) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/uber/NullAway/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/uber/NullAway?branch=master)

NullAway is a tool to help eliminate `NullPointerException`s (NPEs) in your Java code.  To use NullAway, first add `@Nullable` annotations in your code wherever a field, method parameter, or return value may be `null`.  Given these annotations, NullAway performs a series of type-based, local checks to ensure that any pointer that gets dereferenced in your code cannot be `null`.  NullAway is similar to the type-based nullability checking in the Kotlin and Swift languages, and the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/) and [Eradicate](http://fbinfer.com/docs/eradicate.html) null checkers for Java.

NullAway is *fast*.  It is built as a plugin to [Error Prone](http://errorprone.info/) and can run on every single build of your code.  In our measurements, the build-time overhead of running NullAway is usually less than 10%.  NullAway is also *practical*: it does not prevent all possible NPEs in your code, but it catches most of the NPEs we have observed in production while imposing a reasonable annotation burden, giving a great ""bang for your buck.""  At Uber, we combine NullAway with [RAVE](https://github.com/uber-common/rave) to obtain thorough protection against NPEs in our Android apps.

## Installation

### Overview

NullAway requires that you build your code with [Error Prone](http://errorprone.info), version 2.1.1 or higher.  See the [Error Prone documentation](http://errorprone.info/docs/installation) for instructions on getting started with Error Prone and integration with your build system.  The instructions below assume you are using Gradle; see [the docs](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki/Configuration#other-build-systems) for discussion of other build systems.

### Gradle

#### Java (non-Android)

To integrate NullAway into your non-Android Java project, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
plugins {
  // we assume you are already using the Java plugin
  id ""net.ltgt.errorprone"" version ""0.6""
}

dependencies {
  annotationProcessor ""com.uber.nullaway:nullaway:0.7.8""

  // Optional, some source of nullability annotations.
  // Not required on Android if you use the support 
  // library nullability annotations.
  compileOnly ""com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2""

  errorprone ""com.google.errorprone:error_prone_core:2.3.2""
  errorproneJavac ""com.google.errorprone:javac:9+181-r4173-1""
}

import net.ltgt.gradle.errorprone.CheckSeverity

tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
  // remove the if condition if you want to run NullAway on test code
  if (!name.toLowerCase().contains(""test"")) {
    options.errorprone {
      check(""NullAway"", CheckSeverity.ERROR)
      option(""NullAway:AnnotatedPackages"", ""com.uber"")
    }
  }
}
```

Let's walk through this script step by step.  The `plugins` section pulls in the [Gradle Error Prone plugin](https://github.com/tbroyer/gradle-errorprone-plugin) for Error Prone integration. If you are using the older `apply plugin` syntax instead of a `plugins` block, the following is equivalent:
```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    gradlePluginPortal()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath ""net.ltgt.gradle:gradle-errorprone-plugin:0.6""
  }
}

apply plugin: 'net.ltgt.errorprone'
```

In `dependencies`, the `annotationProcessor` line loads NullAway, and the `compileOnly` line loads a [JSR 305](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305) library which provides a suitable `@Nullable` annotation (`javax.annotation.Nullable`).  NullAway allows for any `@Nullable` annotation to be used, so, e.g., `@Nullable` from the Android Support Library or JetBrains annotations is also fine. The `errorprone` line ensures that a compatible version of Error Prone is used, and the `errorproneJavac` line is needed for JDK 8 compatibility.

Finally, in the `tasks.withType(JavaCompile)` section, we pass some configuration options to NullAway.  First `check(""NullAway"", CheckSeverity.ERROR)` sets NullAway issues to the error level (it's equivalent to the `-Xep:NullAway:ERROR` standard Error Prone argument); by default NullAway emits warnings.  Then, `option(""NullAway:AnnotatedPackages"", ""com.uber"")` (equivalent to the `-XepOpt:NullAway:AnnotatedPackages=com.uber` standard Error Prone argument), tells NullAway that source code in packages under the `com.uber` namespace should be checked for null dereferences and proper usage of `@Nullable` annotations, and that class files in these packages should be assumed to have correct usage of `@Nullable` (see [the docs](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki/Configuration) for more detail).  NullAway requires at least the `AnnotatedPackages` configuration argument to run, in order to distinguish between annotated and unannotated code.  See [the configuration docs](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki/Configuration) for other useful configuration options.

We recommend addressing all the issues that Error Prone reports, particularly those reported as errors (rather than warnings).  But, if you'd like to try out NullAway without running other Error Prone checks, you can use `options.errorprone.disableAllChecks` (equivalent to passing `""-XepDisableAllChecks""` to the compiler, before the NullAway-specific arguments).

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's snapshots repository][snapshots].

#### Android

The configuration for an Android project is very similar to the Java case, with one key difference: The `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2` dependency can be removed; you can use the `android.support.annotation.Nullable` annotation from the Android Support library.

```gradle
dependencies {
  annotationProcessor ""com.uber.nullaway:nullaway:0.7.8""
}
```
A complete Android `build.gradle` example is [here](https://gist.github.com/msridhar/6cacd429567f1d1ad9a278e06809601c).  Also see our [sample app](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/blob/master/sample-app/).

#### Annotation Processors / Generated Code

Some annotation processors like [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) and [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value) generate code into the same package namespace as your own code.  This can cause problems when setting NullAway to the `ERROR` level as suggested above, since errors in this generated code will block the build.  Currently the best solution to this problem is to completely disable Error Prone on generated code, using the `-XepExcludedPaths` option added in Error Prone 2.13 (documented [here](http://errorprone.info/docs/flags), use `options.errorprone.excludedPaths=` in Gradle).  To use, figure out which directory contains the generated code, and add that directory to the excluded path regex.

**Note for Dagger users**: Dagger versions older than 2.12 can have bad interactions with NullAway; see [here](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/issues/48#issuecomment-340018409).  Please update to Dagger 2.12 to fix the problem.

## Code Example

Let's see how NullAway works on a simple code example:
```java
static void log(Object x) {
    System.out.println(x.toString());
}
static void foo() {
    log(null);
}
```
This code is buggy: when `foo()` is called, the subsequent call to `log()` will fail with an NPE.  You can see this error in the NullAway sample app by running:
```bash
cp sample/src/main/java/com/uber/mylib/MyClass.java.buggy sample/src/main/java/com/uber/mylib/MyClass.java
./gradlew build
```

By default, NullAway assumes every method parameter, return value, and field is _non-null_, i.e., it can never be assigned a `null` value.  In the above code, the `x` parameter of `log()` is assumed to be non-null.  So, NullAway reports the following error:
```
warning: [NullAway] passing @Nullable parameter 'null' where @NonNull is required
    log(null);
        ^
```
We can fix this error by allowing `null` to be passed to `log()`, with a `@Nullable` annotation:
```java
static void log(@Nullable Object x) {
    System.out.println(x.toString());
}
```
With this annotation, NullAway points out the possible null dereference:
```
warning: [NullAway] dereferenced expression x is @Nullable
    System.out.println(x.toString());
                        ^
```
We can fix this warning by adding a null check:
```java
static void log(@Nullable Object x) {
    if (x != null) {
        System.out.println(x.toString());
    }
}
```
With this change, all the NullAway warnings are fixed.

For more details on NullAway's checks, error messages, and limitations, see [our detailed guide](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki).

Java Native Access (JNA)
========================

The definitive JNA reference (including an overview and usage details) is in the [JavaDoc](http://java-native-access.github.io/jna/5.4.0/javadoc/).  Please read the [overview](http://java-native-access.github.io/jna/5.4.0/javadoc/overview-summary.html#overview_description).  Questions, comments, or exploratory conversations should begin on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jna-users), although you may find it easier to find answers to already-solved problems on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jna).

JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without writing anything but Java code - no JNI or native code is required. This functionality is comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes.

JNA allows you to call directly into native functions using natural Java method invocation. The Java call looks just like the call does in native code. Most calls require no special handling or configuration; no boilerplate or generated code is required.

JNA uses a small JNI library stub to dynamically invoke native code. The developer uses a Java interface to describe functions and structures in the target native library. This makes it quite easy to take advantage of native platform features without incurring the high overhead of configuring and building JNI code for multiple platforms.  Read this [more in-depth description](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/www/FunctionalDescription.md).

While significant attention has been paid to performance, correctness and ease of use take priority.

In addition, JNA includes a platform library with many native functions already mapped as well as a set of utility interfaces that simplify native access.

Supported Platforms
===================
JNA will build on most linux-like platforms with a reasonable set of GNU tools and a JDK.  See the native [Makefile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/java-native-access/jna/master/native/Makefile) for native configurations that have been built and tested.  If your platform is supported by [libffi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libffi), then chances are you can build JNA for it.

Pre-built platform support may be found [here](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/tree/master/lib/native).

## 安全考虑

1. 开发语言：系统采用Java 语言开发，具有卓越的通用性、高效性、平台移植性和安全性。
2. 分层设计：（数据库层，数据访问层，业务逻辑层，展示层）层次清楚，低耦合，各层必须通过接口才能接入并进行参数校验（如：在展示层不可直接操作数据库），保证数据操作的安全。
3. 双重验证：用户表单提交双验证：包括服务器端验证及客户端验证，防止用户通过浏览器恶意修改（如不可写文本域、隐藏变量篡改、上传非法文件等），跳过客户端验证操作数据库。
4. 安全编码：用户表单提交所有数据，在服务器端都进行安全编码，防止用户提交非法脚本及SQL注入获取敏感数据等，确保数据安全。
5. 密码加密：登录用户密码进行SHA1散列加密，此加密方法是不可逆的。保证密文泄露后的安全问题。
6. 强制访问：系统对所有管理端链接都进行用户身份权限验证，防止用户直接填写url进行访问。

## 快速体验

1. 具备运行环境：JDK1.6+、Maven3.0+、MySql5+或Oracle10g+。
2. 修改src\\main\\resources\\jeesite.properties文件中的数据库设置参数。
3. 根据修改参数创建对应MySql或Oracle数据库用户和参数。
4. 运行bin\\init-db.bat脚本，即可导入表结构及演示数据(linux操作系统：在控制台中切换至项目根目录，运行命令：mvn antrun:run -Pinit-db)
5. 运行bin\\run-tomcat7.bat或bin\\run-jetty.bat，启动Web服务器（第一次运行，需要下载依赖jar包，请耐心等待）。
6. 最高管理员账号，用户名：thinkgem 密码：admin

## 常见问题

1. 用一段时间提示内存溢出，请修改JVM参数：-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
2. 有时出现文字乱码：修改Tomcat的server.xml文件的Connector项，增加URIEncoding=""UTF-8""
3. 为什么新建菜单后看不到新建的菜单？因为授权问题，菜单管理只允许最高管理员账号管理（最高管理员默认账号：thinkgem 密码：admin）。

##为何使用MyBatis

* 学习成本：Hibernate的真正掌握要比Mybatis来得难不少。Mybatis框架相对简单很容易上手，也更加灵活。
对于学习过Hibernate的用户，学习起MyBatis也更容易上手。

* 开发成本：大家都说Hibernate开发效率高，个人认为MyBatis的开发效率并不比Hibernate低，
通过代码生成器和封装开发效率不是问题，并且MyBatis可控性比较高，并更易于维护。

* 性能方面：由于Hibernate比较难以掌握，性能方面也成为了Hibernate的问题瓶颈，当然如果你对Hibernate非常熟，
Hibernate性能上定不是问题。但对于大多数情况下，真正掌握Hibernate的人少之又少，然而的也就造就了项目风险加大。

* 多数据库支持：有些人说MyBatis对多数据库支持困难，我认为这个不是问题，虽说目前JeeSite仅提供对MySql或Oracle
数据库的支持，但对于支持其它数据库的改动也不是很麻烦，SQL是被专门写在XML中，对于大多数SQL来说都是通用的，
对于不同的数据库可通过dbName区分和修改各别的SQL片段即可。

上述纯属个人观点，欢迎指正（thinkgem@163.com）。

  repositories {
    maven { url ""https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"" }
  }
}
```

# Documentation
See the [project website](http://hannesdorfmann.com/mosby/).

For Model-View-Intent check out [this blog post series](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/mosby3-mvi-1).

# Changelog
The changelog can be found in the [release section](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby/releases)

# Migrating
In Mosby 3.0 we have changed the package name from `com.hannesdorfmann.mosby` to `com.hannesdorfmann.mosby3` (note the **3** at the end).
Migrating a Mosby 2.x based app to Mosby 3.0 should be straightforward:
Just replace all import statements of your app in android studio with `Edit -> Find -> Replace in Path ...`
and set find `import com.hannesdorfmann.mosby` replace with `import com.hannesdorfmann.mosby3`.
There were also some minor API changes (see [changelog](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby/releases)),
but most apps should be fine by replacing the import statements.

# Conductor
Mosby has a plugin for [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor). You can find it here: https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby-conductor

##1.7.2-SNAPSHOT(master)变更主要点
1. 优化JobContext中的BizLogger，由原来的去掉了threadlocal，解决taskTracker多线程的问题, 去掉LtsLoggerFactory.getLogger()用法

## 框架概况
LTS 有主要有以下四种节点：

* JobClient：主要负责提交任务, 并接收任务执行反馈结果。
* JobTracker：负责接收并分配任务，任务调度。
* TaskTracker：负责执行任务，执行完反馈给JobTracker。
* LTS-Admin：（管理后台）主要负责节点管理，任务队列管理，监控管理等。

其中JobClient，JobTracker，TaskTracker节点都是`无状态`的。
可以部署多个并动态的进行删减，来实现负载均衡，实现更大的负载量, 并且框架采用FailStore策略使LTS具有很好的容错能力。 

LTS注册中心提供多种实现（Zookeeper，redis等），注册中心进行节点信息暴露，master选举。(Mongo or Mysql)存储任务队列和任务执行日志, netty or mina做底层通信, 并提供多种序列化方式fastjson, hessian2, java等。

LTS支持任务类型：

* 实时任务：提交了之后立即就要执行的任务。
* 定时任务：在指定时间点执行的任务，譬如 今天3点执行（单次）。
* Cron任务：CronExpression，和quartz类似（但是不是使用quartz实现的）譬如 0 0/1 * * * ?

支持动态修改任务参数,任务执行时间等设置,支持后台动态添加任务,支持Cron任务暂停,支持手动停止正在执行的任务(有条件),支持任务的监控统计,支持各个节点的任务执行监控,JVM监控等等.

![LTS architecture](http://git.oschina.net/hugui/light-task-scheduler/raw/master/docs/LTS_architecture.png?dir=0&filepath=docs%2FLTS_architecture.png&oid=262a5234534e2d9fa8862f3e632c5551ebd95e21&sha=d01be5d59e8d768f49bbdc66c8334c37af8f7af5)

## 概念说明

###节点组
1. 英文名称 NodeGroup,一个节点组等同于一个小的集群，同一个节点组中的各个节点是对等的，等效的，对外提供相同的服务。
2. 每个节点组中都有一个master节点，这个master节点是由LTS动态选出来的，当一个master节点挂掉之后，LTS会立马选出另外一个master节点，框架提供API监听接口给用户。

###FailStore
1. 顾名思义，这个主要是用于失败了存储的，主要用于节点容错，当远程数据交互失败之后，存储在本地，等待远程通信恢复的时候，再将数据提交。
2. FailStore主要用户JobClient的任务提交，TaskTracker的任务反馈，TaskTracker的业务日志传输的场景下。
3. FailStore目前提供几种实现：leveldb,rocksdb,berkeleydb,mapdb,ltsdb，用于可以自由选择使用哪种,用户也可以采用SPI扩展使用自己的实现。


## 流程图
下图是一个标准的实时任务执行流程。

目前后台带有由[ztajy](https://github.com/ztajy)提供的一个简易的认证功能. 用户名密码在auth.cfg中,用户自行修改.

##特性
###1、Spring支持
LTS可以完全不用Spring框架，但是考虑到很用用户项目中都是用了Spring框架，所以LTS也提供了对Spring的支持，包括Xml和注解，引入`lts-spring.jar`即可。
###2、业务日志记录器
在TaskTracker端提供了业务日志记录器，供应用程序使用，通过这个业务日志器，可以将业务日志提交到JobTracker，这些业务日志可以通过任务ID串联起来，可以在LTS-Admin中实时查看任务的执行进度。
###3、SPI扩展支持
SPI扩展可以达到零侵入，只需要实现相应的接口，并实现即可被LTS使用，目前开放出来的扩展接口有

1. 对任务队列的扩展，用户可以不选择使用mysql或者mongo作为队列存储，也可以自己实现。
2. 对业务日志记录器的扩展，目前主要支持console，mysql，mongo，用户也可以通过扩展选择往其他地方输送日志。

###4、故障转移
当正在执行任务的TaskTracker宕机之后，JobTracker会立马将分配在宕机的TaskTracker的所有任务再分配给其他正常的TaskTracker节点执行。
###5、节点监控
可以对JobTracker，TaskTracker节点进行资源监控，任务监控等，可以实时的在LTS-Admin管理后台查看，进而进行合理的资源调配。
###6、多样化任务执行结果支持
LTS框架提供四种执行结果支持，`EXECUTE_SUCCESS`，`EXECUTE_FAILED`，`EXECUTE_LATER`，`EXECUTE_EXCEPTION`，并对每种结果采取相应的处理机制，譬如重试。

* EXECUTE_SUCCESS: 执行成功,这种情况，直接反馈客户端（如果任务被设置了要反馈给客户端）。
* EXECUTE_FAILED：执行失败，这种情况，直接反馈给客户端，不进行重试。
* EXECUTE_LATER：稍后执行（需要重试），这种情况，不反馈客户端，重试策略采用1min，2min，3min的策略，默认最大重试次数为10次，用户可以通过参数设置修改这个重试次数。
* EXECUTE_EXCEPTION：执行异常, 这种情况也会重试(重试策略，同上)

###7、FailStore容错
采用FailStore机制来进行节点容错，Fail And Store，不会因为远程通信的不稳定性而影响当前应用的运行。具体FailStore说明，请参考概念说明中的FailStore说明。

##项目编译打包
项目主要采用maven进行构建，目前提供shell脚本的打包。
环境依赖：`Java(jdk1.6+)` `Maven`

用户使用一般分为两种：
###1、Maven构建
可以通过maven命令将lts的jar包上传到本地仓库中。在父pom.xml中添加相应的repository，并用deploy命令上传即可。具体引用方式可以参考lts中的例子即可。
###2、直接Jar引用
需要将lts的各个模块打包成单独的jar包，并且将所有lts依赖包引入。具体引用哪些jar包可以参考lts中的例子即可。

##JobTracker和LTS-Admin部署
提供`(cmd)windows`和`(shell)linux`两种版本脚本来进行编译和部署:

1. 运行根目录下的`sh build.sh`或`build.cmd`脚本，会在`dist`目录下生成`lts-{version}-bin`文件夹

2. 下面是其目录结构，其中bin目录主要是JobTracker和LTS-Admin的启动脚本。`jobtracker` 中是 JobTracker的配置文件和需要使用到的jar包，`lts-admin`是LTS-Admin相关的war包和配置文件。
lts-{version}-bin的文件结构

```java
-- lts-${version}-bin
    |-- bin
    |   |-- jobtracker.cmd
    |   |-- jobtracker.sh
    |   |-- lts-admin.cmd
    |   |-- lts-admin.sh
    |   |-- lts-monitor.cmd
    |   |-- lts-monitor.sh
    |   |-- tasktracker.sh
    |-- conf
    |   |-- log4j.properties
    |   |-- lts-admin.cfg
    |   |-- lts-monitor.cfg
    |   |-- readme.txt
    |   |-- tasktracker.cfg
    |   |-- zoo
    |       |-- jobtracker.cfg
    |       |-- log4j.properties
    |       |-- lts-monitor.cfg
    |-- lib
    |   |-- *.jar
    |-- war
        |-- jetty
        |   |-- lib
        |       |-- *.jar
        |-- lts-admin.war

```	    
        
3. JobTracker启动。如果你想启动一个节点，直接修改下`conf/zoo`下的配置文件，然后运行 `sh jobtracker.sh zoo start`即可，如果你想启动两个JobTracker节点，那么你需要拷贝一份zoo,譬如命名为`zoo2`,修改下`zoo2`下的配置文件，然后运行`sh jobtracker.sh zoo2 start`即可。logs文件夹下生成`jobtracker-zoo.out`日志。
4. LTS-Admin启动.修改`conf/lts-monitor.cfg`和`conf/lts-admin.cfg`下的配置，然后运行`bin`下的`sh lts-admin.sh`或`lts-admin.cmd`脚本即可。logs文件夹下会生成`lts-admin.out`日志，启动成功在日志中会打印出访问地址，用户可以通过这个访问地址访问了。

##JobClient（部署）使用
需要引入lts的jar包有`lts-jobclient-{version}.jar`，`lts-core-{version}.jar` 及其它第三方依赖jar。
###API方式启动
```java
JobClient jobClient = new RetryJobClient();
jobClient.setNodeGroup(""test_jobClient"");
jobClient.setClusterName(""test_cluster"");
jobClient.setRegistryAddress(""zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181"");
jobClient.start();

// 提交任务
Job job = new Job();
job.setTaskId(""3213213123"");
job.setParam(""shopId"", ""11111"");
job.setTaskTrackerNodeGroup(""test_trade_TaskTracker"");
// job.setCronExpression(""0 0/1 * * * ?"");  // 支持 cronExpression表达式
// job.setTriggerTime(new Date()); // 支持指定时间执行
Response response = jobClient.submitJob(job);
```
    
###Spring XML方式启动
```java
<bean id=""jobClient"" class=""com.github.ltsopensource.spring.JobClientFactoryBean"">
    <property name=""clusterName"" value=""test_cluster""/>
    <property name=""registryAddress"" value=""zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181""/>

            <prop key=""job.fail.store"">leveldb</prop>
        </props>
    </property>
</bean>
```    
###Spring 全注解方式
```java
@Configuration
public class LTSSpringConfig {

    @Bean(name = ""jobClient"")
    public JobClient getJobClient() throws Exception {
        JobClientFactoryBean factoryBean = new JobClientFactoryBean();
        factoryBean.setClusterName(""test_cluster"");
        factoryBean.setRegistryAddress(""zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181"");
        factoryBean.setNodeGroup(""test_jobClient"");
        factoryBean.setMasterChangeListeners(new MasterChangeListener[]{
                new MasterChangeListenerImpl()
        });
        Properties configs = new Properties();
        configs.setProperty(""job.fail.store"", ""leveldb"");
        factoryBean.setConfigs(configs);
        factoryBean.afterPropertiesSet();
        return factoryBean.getObject();
    }
}
```
##TaskTracker(部署使用)
需要引入lts的jar包有`lts-tasktracker-{version}.jar`，`lts-core-{version}.jar` 及其它第三方依赖jar。
###定义自己的任务执行类
```java
public class MyJobRunner implements JobRunner {
    @Override
    public Result run(JobContext jobContext) throws Throwable {
        try {
            // TODO 业务逻辑
            // 会发送到 LTS (JobTracker上)
            jobContext.getBizLogger().info(""测试，业务日志啊啊啊啊啊"");

        } catch (Exception e) {
            return new Result(Action.EXECUTE_FAILED, e.getMessage());
        }
        return new Result(Action.EXECUTE_SUCCESS, ""执行成功了，哈哈"");
    }
}
```

##参数说明
[参数说明](https://qq254963746.gitbooks.io/lts/content/use/config-name.html)

##使用建议
一般在一个JVM中只需要一个JobClient实例即可，不要为每种任务都新建一个JobClient实例，这样会大大的浪费资源，因为一个JobClient可以提交多种任务。相同的一个JVM一般也尽量保持只有一个TaskTracker实例即可，多了就可能造成资源浪费。当遇到一个TaskTracker要运行多种任务的时候，请参考下面的 ""一个TaskTracker执行多种任务""。
##一个TaskTracker执行多种任务
有的时候，业务场景需要执行多种任务，有些人会问，是不是要每种任务类型都要一个TaskTracker去执行。我的答案是否定的，如果在一个JVM中，最好使用一个TaskTracker去运行多种任务，因为一个JVM中使用多个TaskTracker实例比较浪费资源（当然当你某种任务量比较多的时候，可以将这个任务单独使用一个TaskTracker节点来执行）。那么怎么才能实现一个TaskTracker执行多种任务呢。下面是我给出来的参考例子。

```java
/**
 * 总入口，在 taskTracker.setJobRunnerClass(JobRunnerDispatcher.class)
 * JobClient 提交 任务时指定 Job 类型  job.setParam(""type"", ""aType"")
 */
public class JobRunnerDispatcher implements JobRunner {

    private static final ConcurrentHashMap<String/*type*/, JobRunner>
            JOB_RUNNER_MAP = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, JobRunner>();

    static {
        JOB_RUNNER_MAP.put(""aType"", new JobRunnerA()); // 也可以从Spring中拿
        JOB_RUNNER_MAP.put(""bType"", new JobRunnerB());
    }

    @Override
    public Result run(JobContext jobContext) throws Throwable {
        Job job = jobContext.getJob();
        String type = job.getParam(""type"");
        return JOB_RUNNER_MAP.get(type).run(job);
    }
}

class JobRunnerA implements JobRunner {
    @Override
    public Result run(JobContext jobContext) throws Throwable {
        //  TODO A类型Job的逻辑
        return null;
    }
}

class JobRunnerB implements JobRunner {
    @Override
    public Result run(JobContext jobContext) throws Throwable {
        // TODO B类型Job的逻辑
        return null;
    }
}
```
##TaskTracker的JobRunner测试
一般在编写TaskTracker的时候，只需要测试JobRunner的实现逻辑是否正确，又不想启动LTS进行远程测试。为了方便测试，LTS提供了JobRunner的快捷测试方法。自己的测试类集成`com.github.ltsopensource.tasktracker.runner.JobRunnerTester`即可，并实现`initContext`和`newJobRunner`方法即可。如[lts-examples](https://github.com/ltsopensource/lts-examples)中的例子：

```java
public class TestJobRunnerTester extends JobRunnerTester {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
        //  Mock Job 数据
        Job job = new Job();
        job.setTaskId(""2313213"");

        JobContext jobContext = new JobContext();
        jobContext.setJob(job);

        JobExtInfo jobExtInfo = new JobExtInfo();
        jobExtInfo.setRetry(false);

        jobContext.setJobExtInfo(jobExtInfo);

        // 运行测试
        TestJobRunnerTester tester = new TestJobRunnerTester();
        Result result = tester.run(jobContext);
        System.out.println(JSON.toJSONString(result));
    }

    @Override
    protected void initContext() {
        // TODO 初始化Spring容器
    }

    @Override
    protected JobRunner newJobRunner() {
        return new TestJobRunner();
    }
}
```

##Spring Quartz Cron任务无缝接入
对于Quartz的Cron任务只需要在Spring配置中增加一下代码就可以接入LTS平台

```xml
<bean class=""com.github.ltsopensource.spring.quartz.QuartzLTSProxyBean"">
    <property name=""clusterName"" value=""test_cluster""/>
    <property name=""registryAddress"" value=""zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181""/>
    <property name=""nodeGroup"" value=""quartz_test_group""/>
</bean>
```
##Spring Boot 支持

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableJobTracker       // 启动JobTracker
@EnableJobClient        // 启动JobClient
@EnableTaskTracker      // 启动TaskTracker
@EnableMonitor          // 启动Monitor
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

剩下的就只是在application.properties中添加相应的配置就行了, 具体见lts-example中的`com.github.ltsopensource.examples.springboot`包下的例子


##多网卡选择问题
当机器有内网两个网卡的时候，有时候，用户想让LTS的流量走外网网卡，那么需要在host中，把主机名称的映射地址改为外网网卡地址即可，内网同理。

##关于节点标识问题
如果在节点启动的时候设置节点标识,LTS会默认设置一个UUID为节点标识,可读性会比较差,但是能保证每个节点的唯一性,如果用户能自己保证节点标识的唯一性,可以通过 `setIdentity` 来设置,譬如如果每个节点都是部署在一台机器(一个虚拟机)上,那么可以将identity设置为主机名称

##SPI扩展说明
支持JobLogger,JobQueue等等的SPI扩展

##[和其它解决方案比较](https://qq254963746.gitbooks.io/lts/content/introduce/compareother.html)


##LTS-Admin使用jetty启动(默认)，不定期挂掉解决方案

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/READMEs/nanohttpd-README.md,"## NanoHTTPD – a tiny web server in Java

*NanoHTTPD* is a light-weight HTTP server designed for embedding in other applications, released under a Modified BSD licence.

It is being developed at Github and uses Apache Maven for builds & unit testing:

 * Build status: [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd.png)](https://travis-ci.org/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd)
 * Coverage Status: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd)
 * Current central released version: [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.nanohttpd/nanohttpd/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.nanohttpd/nanohttpd)

## Quickstart

We'll create a custom HTTP server project using Maven for build/dep system. This tutorial assumes you are using a Unix variant and a shell. First, install Maven and Java SDK if not already installed. Then run:

    mvn compile
    mvn exec:java -pl webserver -Dexec.mainClass=""org.nanohttpd.webserver.SimpleWebServer""
    
You should now have a HTTP file server running on <http://localhost:8080/>.

### Custom web app

Let's raise the bar and build a custom web application next:

    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=myHellopApp -DinteractiveMode=false
    cd myHellopApp
    
Edit `pom.xml`, and add this between \\<dependencies\\>:
 
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId> <!-- <groupId>com.nanohttpd</groupId> for 2.1.0 and earlier -->
		<artifactId>nanohttpd</artifactId>
		<version>2.2.0</version>
	</dependency>
	
Edit `src/main/java/com/example/App.java` and replace it with:
```java
    package com.example;
    
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.Map;
    
    import fi.iki.elonen.NanoHTTPD;
    // NOTE: If you're using NanoHTTPD >= 3.0.0 the namespace is different,
    //       instead of the above import use the following:
	// import org.nanohttpd.NanoHTTPD;
    
    public class App extends NanoHTTPD {
    
        public App() throws IOException {
            super(8080);
            start(NanoHTTPD.SOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT, false);
            System.out.println(""\\nRunning! Point your browsers to http://localhost:8080/ \\n"");
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
                new App();
            } catch (IOException ioe) {
                System.err.println(""Couldn't start server:\\n"" + ioe);
            }
        }
    
        @Override
        public Response serve(IHTTPSession session) {
            String msg = ""<html><body><h1>Hello server</h1>\\n"";
            Map<String, String> parms = session.getParms();
            if (parms.get(""username"") == null) {
                msg += ""<form action='?' method='get'>\\n  <p>Your name: <input type='text' name='username'></p>\\n"" + ""</form>\\n"";
            } else {
                msg += ""<p>Hello, "" + parms.get(""username"") + ""!</p>"";
            }
            return newFixedLengthResponse(msg + ""</body></html>\\n"");
        }
    }
```

Compile and run the server:
 
    mvn compile
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=""com.example.App""
    
If it started ok, point your browser at <http://localhost:8080/> and enjoy a web server that asks your name and replies with a greeting. 

### Nanolets

Nanolets are like servlets only that they have a extremely low profile. They offer an easy to use system for a more complex server application.
This text has to be extended with an example, so for now take a look at the unit tests for the usage. <https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd/blob/master/nanolets/src/test/java/org/nanohttpd/junit/router/AppNanolets.java>

## Status

We are currently in the process of stabilizing NanoHTTPD from the many pull requests and feature requests that were integrated over the last few months. The next release will come soon, and there will not be any more ""intended"" major changes before the next release. If you want to use the bleeding edge version, you can clone it from Github, or get it from sonatype.org (see ""Maven dependencies / Living on the edge"" below).

## Project structure

NanoHTTPD project currently consist of four parts:

 * `/core` – Fully functional HTTP(s) server consisting of one (1) Java file, ready to be customized/inherited for your own project.

 * `/samples` – Simple examples on how to customize NanoHTTPD. See *HelloServer.java* for a killer app that greets you enthusiastically!

 * `/websocket` – Websocket implementation, also in a single Java file. Depends on core.

 * `/webserver` – Standalone file server. Run & enjoy. A popular use seems to be serving files out off an Android device.

 * `/nanolets` – Standalone nano app server, giving a servlet like system to the implementor.

 * `/fileupload` – integration of the apache common file upload library.

## Features
### Core
* Only one Java file, providing HTTP 1.1 support.
* No fixed config files, logging, authorization etc. (Implement by yourself if you need them. Errors are passed to java.util.logging, though.)
* Support for HTTPS (SSL).
* Basic support for cookies.
* Supports parameter parsing of GET and POST methods.
* Some built-in support for HEAD, POST and DELETE requests. You can easily implement/customize any HTTP method, though.
* Supports file upload. Uses memory for small uploads, temp files for large ones.
* Never caches anything.
* Does not limit bandwidth, request time or simultaneous connections by default.
* All header names are converted to lower case so they don't vary between browsers/clients.
* Persistent connections (Connection ""keep-alive"") support allowing multiple requests to be served over a single socket connection.

### Websocket
* Tested on Firefox, Chrome and IE.

### Webserver
* Default code serves files and shows (prints on console) all HTTP parameters and headers.
* Supports both dynamic content and file serving.
* File server supports directory listing, `index.html` and `index.htm`.
* File server supports partial content (streaming & continue download).
* File server supports ETags.
* File server does the 301 redirection trick for directories without `/`.
* File server serves also very long files without memory overhead.
* Contains a built-in list of most common MIME types.
* Runtime extension support (extensions that serve particular MIME types) - example extension that serves Markdown formatted files. Simply including an extension JAR in the webserver classpath is enough for the extension to be loaded.
* Simple [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) support via `--cors` parameter
  * by default serves `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: origin,accept,content-type`
  * possibility to set `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` by setting System property: `AccessControlAllowHeader`
  * _example: _ `-DAccessControlAllowHeader=origin,accept,content-type,Authorization`
  * possible values:
      * `--cors`: activates CORS support, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` will be set to `*`.
      * `--cors=some_value`: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` will be set to `some_value`. 

**_CORS argument examples_**


* `--cors=http://appOne.company.com`
* `--cors=""http://appOne.company.com, http://appTwo.company.com""`: note the double quotes so that the two URLs are considered part of a single argument.

## Maven dependencies

NanoHTTPD is a Maven based project and deployed to central. Most development environments have means to access the central repository. The coordinates to use in Maven are: 

	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId> <!-- <groupId>com.nanohttpd</groupId> for 2.1.0 and earlier -->
			<artifactId>nanohttpd</artifactId>
			<version>CURRENT_VERSION</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>

(Replace `CURRENT_VERSION` with whatever is reported latest at <http://nanohttpd.org/>.)

The coordinates for your development environment should correspond to these. When looking for an older version take care because we switched groupId from *com.nanohttpd* to *org.nanohttpd* in mid 2015.

Next it depends what you are using NanoHTTPD for, there are three main usages.

## Gradle dependencies

In gradle you can use NanoHTTPD the same way because gradle accesses the same central repository:

	dependencies {
		runtime(
			[group: 'org.nanohttpd', name: 'nanohttpd', version: 'CURRENT_VERSION'],
		)
	}

(Replace `CURRENT_VERSION` with whatever is reported latest at <http://nanohttpd.org/>.)

Just replace the name with the artifact id of the module you want to use and gradle will find it for you. 

### Develop your own specialized HTTP service

For a specialized HTTP (HTTPS) service you can use the module with artifactId *nanohttpd*.

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId> <!-- <groupId>com.nanohttpd</groupId> for 2.1.0 and earlier -->
			<artifactId>nanohttpd</artifactId>
			<version>CURRENT_VERSION</version>
		</dependency>
		
Here you write your own subclass of *org.nanohttpd.NanoHTTPD* to configure and to serve the requests.
  
### Develop a websocket based service    

For a specialized websocket service you can use the module with artifactId *nanohttpd-websocket*.

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId> <!-- <groupId>com.nanohttpd</groupId> for 2.1.0 and earlier -->
			<artifactId>nanohttpd-websocket</artifactId>
			<version>CURRENT_VERSION</version>
		</dependency>

Here you write your own subclass of *org.nanohttpd.NanoWebSocketServer* to configure and to serve the websocket requests. A small standard echo example is included as *org.nanohttpd.samples.echo.DebugWebSocketServer*. You can use it as a starting point to implement your own services.

### Develop a custom HTTP file server    

For a more classic approach, perhaps to just create a HTTP server serving mostly service files from your disk, you can use the module with artifactId *nanohttpd-webserver*.

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId>
			<artifactId>nanohttpd-webserver</artifactId>
			<version>CURRENT_VERSION</version>
		</dependency>

The included class *org.nanohttpd.SimpleWebServer* is intended to be used as a starting point for your own implementation but it also can be used as is. Starting the class as is will start a HTTP server on port 8080 and publishing the current directory.

### Living on the edge

The latest Github master version can be fetched through sonatype.org:

	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<artifactId>nanohttpd</artifactId>
			<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId>
			<version>XXXXX-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
	...
	<repositories>
		<repository>
			<id>sonatype-snapshots</id>
			<url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
			<snapshots>
				<enabled>true</enabled>
			</snapshots>
		</repository>
	</repositories>

### generating an self signed SSL certificate

Just a hint how to generate a certificate for localhost.

	keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -validity 360 -keysize 2048 -ext SAN=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1  -validity 9999

This will generate a keystore file named 'keystore.jks' with a self signed certificate for a host named localhost with the IP address 127.0.0.1 . Now
you can use:

	server.makeSecure(NanoHTTPD.makeSSLSocketFactory(""/keystore.jks"", ""password"".toCharArray()), null);

Before you start the server to make NanoHTTPD serve HTTPS connections, when you make sure 'keystore.jks' is in your classpath.

- [**Kotlin support**](https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher/blob/master/doc/kotlin_usage.md)
- [**Special Permissions support**](https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher/blob/master/doc/special_permissions.md)
- **100% reflection-free**

PermissionsDispatcher provides a simple annotation-based API to handle runtime permissions.

This library lifts the burden that comes with writing a bunch of check statements whether a permission has been granted or not from you, in order to keep your code clean and safe.

## Usage([Java](https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher/blob/master/doc/java_usage.md))

Here's a minimum example, in which you register a `MainActivity` which requires `Manifest.permission.CAMERA`.

### 0. Prepare AndroidManifest

Add the following line to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
 
`<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.CAMERA"" />`

### 1. Attach annotations

PermissionsDispatcher introduces only a few annotations, keeping its general API concise:

> NOTE: Annotated methods must not be `private`.

|Annotation|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`@RuntimePermissions`|**✓**|Register an `Activity`, `Fragment` or [Controller](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor) to handle permissions|
|`@NeedsPermission`|**✓**|Annotate a method which performs the action that requires one or more permissions|
|`@OnShowRationale`||Annotate a method which explains why the permissions are needed. It passes in a `PermissionRequest` object which can be used to continue or abort the current permission request upon user input. If you don't specify any argument for the method compiler will generate `process${NeedsPermissionMethodName}ProcessRequest` and `cancel${NeedsPermissionMethodName}ProcessRequest`. You can use those methods in place of `PermissionRequest`(ex: with `DialogFragment`)|
|`@OnPermissionDenied`||Annotate a method which is invoked if the user doesn't grant the permissions|
|`@OnNeverAskAgain`||Annotate a method which is invoked if the user chose to have the device ""never ask again"" about a permission|

```kotlin
@RuntimePermissions
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), View.OnClickListener {

    @NeedsPermission(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)
    fun showCamera() {
        supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
                .replace(R.id.sample_content_fragment, CameraPreviewFragment.newInstance())
                .addToBackStack(""camera"")
                .commitAllowingStateLoss()
    }

    @OnShowRationale(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)
    fun showRationaleForCamera(request: PermissionRequest) {
        showRationaleDialog(R.string.permission_camera_rationale, request)
    }

    @OnPermissionDenied(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)
    fun onCameraDenied() {
        Toast.makeText(this, R.string.permission_camera_denied, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }

    @OnNeverAskAgain(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)
    fun onCameraNeverAskAgain() {
        Toast.makeText(this, R.string.permission_camera_never_askagain, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```

### 2. Delegate to generated functions

Now generated functions become much more concise and intuitive than Java version!

```kotlin
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        findViewById(R.id.button_camera).setOnClickListener {
            // NOTE: delegate the permission handling to generated function
            showCameraWithPermissionCheck()
        }
    }

    override fun onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode: Int, permissions: Array<String>, grantResults: IntArray) {
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults)
        // NOTE: delegate the permission handling to generated function
        onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, grantResults)
    }
```

/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Ransomware Project/Combined Benign_v2/READMEs/joda-time-README.md,"Joda-Time
---------

Joda-Time provides a quality replacement for the Java date and time classes.
The design allows for multiple calendar systems, while still providing a simple API.
The 'default' calendar is the ISO8601 standard which is used by XML.
The Gregorian, Julian, Buddhist, Coptic, Ethiopic and Islamic systems are also included.
Supporting classes include time zone, duration, format and parsing. 

**Joda-time is no longer in active development except to keep timezone data up to date.**
From Java SE 8 onwards, users are asked to migrate to `java.time` (JSR-310) - a core part of the JDK which replaces this project.
For Android users, `java.time` is [added in API 26+](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/time/package-summary).
Projects needing to support lower API levels can use [the ThreeTenABP library](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP).

As a flavour of Joda-Time, here's some example code:

```java
public boolean isAfterPayDay(DateTime datetime) {
  if (datetime.getMonthOfYear() == 2) {   // February is month 2!!
    return datetime.getDayOfMonth() > 26;
  }
  return datetime.getDayOfMonth() > 28;
}

public Days daysToNewYear(LocalDate fromDate) {
  LocalDate newYear = fromDate.plusYears(1).withDayOfYear(1);
  return Days.daysBetween(fromDate, newYear);
}

public boolean isRentalOverdue(DateTime datetimeRented) {
  Period rentalPeriod = new Period().withDays(2).withHours(12);
  return datetimeRented.plus(rentalPeriod).isBeforeNow();
}

public String getBirthMonthText(LocalDate dateOfBirth) {
  return dateOfBirth.monthOfYear().getAsText(Locale.ENGLISH);
}
```

Getting Started
---------------

JsonPath is available at the Central Maven Repository. Maven users add this to your POM.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.jayway.jsonpath</groupId>
    <artifactId>json-path</artifactId>
    <version>2.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you need help ask questions at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jsonpath). Tag the question 'jsonpath' and 'java'.

JsonPath expressions always refer to a JSON structure in the same way as XPath expression are used in combination 
with an XML document. The ""root member object"" in JsonPath is always referred to as `$` regardless if it is an 
object or array.

JsonPath expressions can use the dot–notation

`$.store.book[0].title`

or the bracket–notation

`$['store']['book'][0]['title']`

Operators
---------

| Operator                  | Description                                                        |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$`                       | The root element to query. This starts all path expressions.       |
| `@`                       | The current node being processed by a filter predicate.            |
| `*`                       | Wildcard. Available anywhere a name or numeric are required.       |
| `..`                      | Deep scan. Available anywhere a name is required.                  |
| `.<name>`                 | Dot-notated child                                                  |
| `['<name>' (, '<name>')]` | Bracket-notated child or children                                  |
| `[<number> (, <number>)]` | Array index or indexes                                             |
| `[start:end]`             | Array slice operator                                               |
| `[?(<expression>)]`       | Filter expression. Expression must evaluate to a boolean value.    |


Functions
---------

Functions can be invoked at the tail end of a path - the input to a function is the output of the path expression.
The function output is dictated by the function itself.

| Function                  | Description                                                         | Output    |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |-----------|
| min()                     | Provides the min value of an array of numbers                       | Double    |
| max()                     | Provides the max value of an array of numbers                       | Double    |
| avg()                     | Provides the average value of an array of numbers                   | Double    |
| stddev()                  | Provides the standard deviation value of an array of numbers        | Double    |
| length()                  | Provides the length of an array                                     | Integer   |


Filter Operators
-----------------

Filters are logical expressions used to filter arrays. A typical filter would be `[?(@.age > 18)]` where `@` represents the current item being processed. More complex filters can be created with logical operators `&&` and `||`. String literals must be enclosed by single or double quotes (`[?(@.color == 'blue')]` or `[?(@.color == ""blue"")]`).   

| Operator                 | Description                                                           |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ==                       | left is equal to right (note that 1 is not equal to '1')              |
| !=                       | left is not equal to right                                            |
| <                        | left is less than right                                               |
| <=                       | left is less or equal to right                                        |
| >                        | left is greater than right                                            |
| >=                       | left is greater than or equal to right                                |
| =~                       | left matches regular expression  [?(@.name =~ /foo.*?/i)]             |

| nin                      | left does not exists in right                                         |
| subsetof                 | left is a subset of right [?(@.sizes subsetof ['S', 'M', 'L'])]       |
| anyof                    | left has an intersection with right [?(@.sizes anyof ['M', 'L'])]     |

Reading a Document
------------------
The simplest most straight forward way to use JsonPath is via the static read API.

```java
String json = ""..."";

List<String> authors = JsonPath.read(json, ""$.store.book[*].author"");
```

If you only want to read once this is OK. In case you need to read an other path as well this is not the way 
to go since the document will be parsed every time you call JsonPath.read(...). To avoid the problem you can 
parse the json first.

```java
String json = ""..."";
Object document = Configuration.defaultConfiguration().jsonProvider().parse(json);

String author0 = JsonPath.read(document, ""$.store.book[0].author"");
String author1 = JsonPath.read(document, ""$.store.book[1].author"");
```
JsonPath also provides a fluent API. This is also the most flexible one.

```java
String json = ""..."";

ReadContext ctx = JsonPath.parse(json);

List<String> authorsOfBooksWithISBN = ctx.read(""$.store.book[?(@.isbn)].author"");


List<Map<String, Object>> expensiveBooks = JsonPath
                            .using(configuration)
                            .parse(json)
                            .read(""$.store.book[?(@.price > 10)]"", List.class);
```

What is Returned When?
----------------------
When using JsonPath in java its important to know what type you expect in your result. JsonPath will automatically 
try to cast the result to the type expected by the invoker.

```java
//Will throw an java.lang.ClassCastException    
List<String> list = JsonPath.parse(json).read(""$.store.book[0].author"")

//Works fine
String author = JsonPath.parse(json).read(""$.store.book[0].author"")
```

When evaluating a path you need to understand the concept of when a path is `definite`. A path is `indefinite` if it contains:

* `..` - a deep scan operator
* `?(<expression>)` - an expression
* `[<number>, <number> (, <number>)]` - multiple array indexes

`Indefinite` paths always returns a list (as represented by current JsonProvider). 

By default a simple object mapper is provided by the MappingProvider SPI. This allows you to specify the return type you want and the MappingProvider will
try to perform the mapping. In the example below mapping between `Long` and `Date` is demonstrated. 

```java
String json = ""{\\""date_as_long\\"" : 1411455611975}"";

Date date = JsonPath.parse(json).read(""$['date_as_long']"", Date.class);
```

If you configure JsonPath to use `JacksonMappingProvider` or `GsonMappingProvider` you can even map your JsonPath output directly into POJO's.

```java
Book book = JsonPath.parse(json).read(""$.store.book[0]"", Book.class);
```

To obtainin full generics type information, use TypeRef.

```java
TypeRef<List<String>> typeRef = new TypeRef<List<String>>() {};

List<String> titles = JsonPath.parse(JSON_DOCUMENT).read(""$.store.book[*].title"", typeRef);
```

Predicates
----------
There are three different ways to create filter predicates in JsonPath.

### Inline Predicates

Inline predicates are the ones defined in the path.

```java
List<Map<String, Object>> books =  JsonPath.parse(json)
                                     .read(""$.store.book[?(@.price < 10)]"");
```

You can use `&&` and `||` to combine multiple predicates `[?(@.price < 10 && @.category == 'fiction')]` , 
`[?(@.category == 'reference' || @.price > 10)]`.
 
You can use `!` to negate a predicate `[?(!(@.price < 10 && @.category == 'fiction'))]`.

### Filter Predicates
 
Predicates can be built using the Filter API as shown below:

```java
import static com.jayway.jsonpath.JsonPath.parse;
import static com.jayway.jsonpath.Criteria.where;
import static com.jayway.jsonpath.Filter.filter;
...
...

Filter cheapFictionFilter = filter(
   where(""category"").is(""fiction"").and(""price"").lte(10D)
);

List<Map<String, Object>> books =  
   parse(json).read(""$.store.book[?]"", cheapFictionFilter);

```
Notice the placeholder `?` for the filter in the path. When multiple filters are provided they are applied in order where the number of placeholders must match 
the number of provided filters. You can specify multiple predicate placeholders in one filter operation `[?, ?]`, both predicates must match. 

Filters can also be combined with 'OR' and 'AND'
```java
Filter fooOrBar = filter(
   where(""foo"").exists(true)).or(where(""bar"").exists(true)
);
   
Filter fooAndBar = filter(
   where(""foo"").exists(true)).and(where(""bar"").exists(true)
);
```

### Roll Your Own
 
Third option is to implement your own predicates
 
```java 
Predicate booksWithISBN = new Predicate() {
    @Override
    public boolean apply(PredicateContext ctx) {
        return ctx.item(Map.class).containsKey(""isbn"");
    }
};

List<Map<String, Object>> books = 
   reader.read(""$.store.book[?].isbn"", List.class, booksWithISBN);
```

Path vs Value
-------------
In the Goessner implementation a JsonPath can return either `Path` or `Value`. `Value` is the default and what all the examples above are returning. If you rather have the path of the elements our query is hitting this can be achieved with an option.

```java
Configuration conf = Configuration.builder()
   .options(Option.AS_PATH_LIST).build();

List<String> pathList = using(conf).parse(json).read(""$..author"");

assertThat(pathList).containsExactly(
    ""$['store']['book'][0]['author']"",
    ""$['store']['book'][1]['author']"",
    ""$['store']['book'][2]['author']"",
    ""$['store']['book'][3]['author']"");
```


Tweaking Configuration
----------------------

### Options
When creating your Configuration there are a few option flags that can alter the default behaviour.

**DEFAULT_PATH_LEAF_TO_NULL**
<br/>
This option makes JsonPath return null for missing leafs. Consider the following json

```javascript
[
   {
      ""name"" : ""john"",
      ""gender"" : ""male""
   },
   {
      ""name"" : ""ben""
   }
]
```

```java
Configuration conf = Configuration.defaultConfiguration();

//Works fine
String gender0 = JsonPath.using(conf).parse(json).read(""$[0]['gender']"");
//PathNotFoundException thrown
String gender1 = JsonPath.using(conf).parse(json).read(""$[1]['gender']"");

Configuration conf2 = conf.addOptions(Option.DEFAULT_PATH_LEAF_TO_NULL);

//Works fine
String gender0 = JsonPath.using(conf2).parse(json).read(""$[0]['gender']"");
//Works fine (null is returned)
String gender1 = JsonPath.using(conf2).parse(json).read(""$[1]['gender']"");
```
 
**ALWAYS_RETURN_LIST**
<br/>
This option configures JsonPath to return a list even when the path is `definite`. 
 
```java
Configuration conf = Configuration.defaultConfiguration();

//Works fine
List<String> genders0 = JsonPath.using(conf).parse(json).read(""$[0]['gender']"");
//PathNotFoundException thrown
List<String> genders1 = JsonPath.using(conf).parse(json).read(""$[1]['gender']"");
``` 
**SUPPRESS_EXCEPTIONS**
<br/>
This option makes sure no exceptions are propagated from path evaluation. It follows these simple rules:

* If option `ALWAYS_RETURN_LIST` is present an empty list will be returned
* If option `ALWAYS_RETURN_LIST` is **NOT** present null returned 


### JsonProvider SPI

JsonPath is shipped with five different JsonProviders:

* [JsonSmartJsonProvider](https://code.google.com/p/json-smart/) (default)
* [JacksonJsonProvider](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
* [JacksonJsonNodeJsonProvider](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
* [GsonJsonProvider](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) 
* [JsonOrgJsonProvider](http://www.json.org/java/index.html)

Changing the configuration defaults as demonstrated should only be done when your application is being initialized. Changes during runtime is strongly discouraged, especially in multi threaded applications.
  

```java
Configuration.setDefaults(new Configuration.Defaults() {

    private final JsonProvider jsonProvider = new JacksonJsonProvider();
    private final MappingProvider mappingProvider = new JacksonMappingProvider();
      
    @Override
    public JsonProvider jsonProvider() {
        return jsonProvider;
    }

    @Override
    public MappingProvider mappingProvider() {
        return mappingProvider;
    }
    
    @Override
    public Set<Option> options() {
        return EnumSet.noneOf(Option.class);
    }
});
```

Note that the JacksonJsonProvider requires `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.4.5` and the GsonJsonProvider requires `com.google.code.gson:gson:2.3.1` on your classpath. 

### Cache SPI

In JsonPath 2.1.0 a new Cache SPI was introduced. This allows API consumers to configure path caching in a way that suits their needs. The cache must be configured before it is accesses for the first time or a JsonPathException is thrown. JsonPath ships with two cache implementations

* `com.jayway.jsonpath.spi.cache.LRUCache` (default, thread safe)
* `com.jayway.jsonpath.spi.cache.NOOPCache` (no cache)

If you want to implement your own cache the API is simple. 

```java
CacheProvider.setCache(new Cache() {
    //Not thread safe simple cache
    private Map<String, JsonPath> map = new HashMap<String, JsonPath>();

    @Override
    public JsonPath get(String key) {
        return map.get(key);
    }

    @Override
    public void put(String key, JsonPath jsonPath) {
        map.put(key, jsonPath);
    }
});
```

## Introduction

As distributed systems become increasingly popular, the reliability between services is becoming more important than ever before.
Sentinel takes ""flow"" as breakthrough point, and works on multiple fields including **flow control**, **circuit breaking** and **system adaptive protection**, to guarantee reliability of microservices.

Sentinel has the following features:

- **Rich applicable scenarios**: Sentinel has been wildly used in Alibaba, and has covered almost all the core-scenarios in Double-11 (11.11) Shopping Festivals in the past 10 years, such as “Second Kill” which needs to limit burst flow traffic to meet the system capacity, message peak clipping and valley fills, circuit breaking for unreliable downstream services, cluster flow control, etc.
- **Real-time monitoring**: Sentinel also provides real-time monitoring ability. You can see the runtime information of a single machine in real-time, and the aggregated runtime info of a cluster with less than 500 nodes.
- **Widespread open-source ecosystem**: Sentinel provides out-of-box integrations with commonly-used frameworks and libraries such as Spring Cloud, Dubbo and gRPC. You can easily use Sentinel by simply add the adapter dependency to your services.
- **Various SPI extensions**: Sentinel provides easy-to-use SPI extension interfaces that allow you to quickly customize your logic, for example, custom rule management, adapting data sources, and so on.

Features overview:

![features-of-sentinel](./doc/image/sentinel-features-overview-en.png)

## Documentation

See the [中文文档](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D) for document in Chinese.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki) for full documentation, examples, blog posts, operational details and other information.

Sentinel provides integration module for various open-source frameworks and libraries
(e.g. Spring Cloud, Apache Dubbo, gRPC, Spring WebFlux, Reactor). You can refer to [the document](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/Adapters-to-Popular-Framework) for more information.

If you are using Sentinel, please [**leave a comment here**](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/issues/18) to tell us your scenario to make Sentinel better.
It's also encouraged to add the link of your blog post, tutorial, demo or customized components to [**Awesome Sentinel**](./doc/awesome-sentinel.md).

## Ecosystem Landscape

![ecosystem-landscape](./doc/image/sentinel-opensource-eco-landscape-en.png)

## Quick Start

Below is a simple demo that guides new users to use Sentinel in just 3 steps. It also shows how to monitor this demo using the dashboard.

### 1. Add Dependency

**Note:** Sentinel requires Java 7 or later.

If your application is build in Maven, just add the following dependency in `pom.xml`.

```xml
<!-- replace here with the latest version -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba.csp</groupId>
    <artifactId>sentinel-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.6.3</version>
</dependency>
```

If not, you can download JAR in [Maven Center Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.alibaba.csp/sentinel-core).

### 2. Define Resource

Wrap your code snippet via Sentinel API: `SphU.entry(resourceName)`.
In below example, it is `System.out.println(""hello world"");`:

```java
try (Entry entry = SphU.entry(""HelloWorld"")) {
    // Your business logic here.
    System.out.println(""hello world"");
} catch (BlockException e) {
    // Handle rejected request.
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

So far the code modification is done. We also provide [annotation support module](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/blob/master/sentinel-extension/sentinel-annotation-aspectj/README.md) to define resource easier.

### 3. Define Rules

If we want to limit the access times of the resource, we can **set rules to the resource**.
The following code defines a rule that limits access to the resource to 20 times per second at the maximum.

```java
List<FlowRule> rules = new ArrayList<>();
FlowRule rule = new FlowRule();
rule.setResource(""HelloWorld"");
// set limit qps to 20
rule.setCount(20);
rule.setGrade(RuleConstant.FLOW_GRADE_QPS);
rules.add(rule);
FlowRuleManager.loadRules(rules);
```

For more information, please refer to [How To Use](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/How-to-Use).

### 4. Check the Result

After running the demo for a while, you can see the following records in `~/logs/csp/${appName}-metrics.log.{date}` (When using the default `DateFileLogHandler`).

```
|--timestamp-|------date time----|-resource-|p |block|s |e|rt  |occupied
1529998904000|2018-06-26 15:41:44|HelloWorld|20|0    |20|0|0   |0
1529998905000|2018-06-26 15:41:45|HelloWorld|20|5579 |20|0|728 |0
1529998906000|2018-06-26 15:41:46|HelloWorld|20|15698|20|0|0   |0
1529998907000|2018-06-26 15:41:47|HelloWorld|20|19262|20|0|0   |0
1529998908000|2018-06-26 15:41:48|HelloWorld|20|19502|20|0|0   |0
1529998909000|2018-06-26 15:41:49|HelloWorld|20|18386|20|0|0   |0

p stands for incoming request, block for blocked by rules, success for success handled by Sentinel, e for exception count, rt for average response time (ms), occupied stands for occupiedPassQps since 1.5.0 which enable us booking more than 1 shot when entering.
```

This shows that the demo can print ""hello world"" 20 times per second.

More examples and information can be found in the [How To Use](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/How-to-Use) section.

The working principles of Sentinel can be found in [How it works](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/How-it-works) section.

Samples can be found in the [sentinel-demo](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/tree/master/sentinel-demo) module.

### 5. Start Dashboard

Sentinel also provides a simple dashboard application, on which you can monitor the clients and configure the rules in real time.

![dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9434884/55449295-84866d80-55fd-11e9-94e5-d3441f4a2b63.png)

For details please refer to [Dashboard](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/Dashboard).

In Android, http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcelable.html[Parcelables] are a great way to serialize Java Objects between Contexts.
http://www.developerphil.com/parcelable-vs-serializable/[Compared] with traditional Serialization, Parcelables take on the order of 10x less time to both serialize and deserialize.
There is a major flaw with Parcelables, however.
Parcelables contain a ton of boilerplate code.
To implement a Parcelable, you must mirror the `writeToParcel()` and `createFromParcel()` methods such that they read and write to the Parcel in the same order.
Also, a Parcelable must define a `public static final Parcelable.Creator CREATOR` in order for the Android infrastructure to be able to leverage the serialization code.

Parceler is a code generation library that generates the Android Parcelable boilerplate source code.
No longer do you have to implement the Parcelable interface, the `writeToParcel()` or `createFromParcel()` or the `public static final CREATOR`.
You simply annotate a POJO with `@Parcel` and Parceler does the rest.
Because Parceler uses the Java JSR-269 Annotation Processor, there is no need to run a tool manually to generate the Parcelable code.
Just annotate your Java Bean, compile and you are finished.
By default, Parceler will serialize the fields of your instance directly:

[source,java]
----
@Parcel
public class Example {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Example() {}

    public Example(int age, String name) {
        this.age = age;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }

    public int getAge() { return age; }
}
----

Be careful not to use private fields when using the default field serialization strategy as it will incur a performance penalty due to reflection.

To use the generated code, you may reference the generated class directly, or via the `Parcels` utility class:

[source,java]
----
Parcelable wrapped = Parcels.wrap(new Example(""Andy"", 42));
----

To dereference the `@Parcel`, just call the `Parcels.unwrap()` method:

[source,java]
----
Example example = Parcels.unwrap(wrapped);
example.getName(); // Andy
example.getAge(); // 42
----

Of course, the wrapped `Parcelable` can be added to an Android Bundle to transfer from Activity to Activity:

[source,java]
----
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
bundle.putParcelable(""example"", Parcels.wrap(example));
----

And dereferenced in the `onCreate()` method:

[source,java]
----
Example example = Parcels.unwrap(getIntent().getParcelableExtra(""example""));
----

This wrapping and unwrapping technique plays well with the Intent Factory pattern.
In addition, Parceler is supported by the following libraries:

 * http://androidtransfuse.org/documentation.html#parcel[Transfuse] - Allows `@Parcel` annotated beans to be used with the `@Extra` injection.
 * https://github.com/sockeqwe/fragmentargs#argsbundler[FragmentArgs] - Uses the `ParcelerArgsBundler` adapter to wrap and unwrap `@Parcel` annotated beans with fragment parameters.
 * https://github.com/f2prateek/dart[Dart] - Autodetects `@Parcel` annotated beans and automatically unwraps them when using `@InjectExtra`.
 * http://androidannotations.org/[AndroidAnnotations] - Autodetects `@Parcel` annotated beans and https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations/wiki/ParcelerIntegration[automatically wraps/unwraps] them when using `@Extra`, `@FragmentArg`, `@InstanceState` and other `Bundle` related annotations.
 * https://github.com/MarcinMoskala/ActivityStarter/wiki/Parceler-Arg-Converter-usage[ActivityStarter] - Supports natively Parceler objects as arguments to Activities, Fragments, Services, etc.
 * https://josesamuel.com/remoter/[Remoter] - Supports natively Parceler objects as arguments in @Remoter interfaces. 

=== Parcel attribute types
Only a select number of types may be used as attributes of a `@Parcel` class.
The following list includes the mapped types:

 * `byte`
 * `double`
 * `float`
 * `int`
 * `long`
 * `char`
 * `boolean`
 * `String`
 * `IBinder`
 * `Bundle`
 * `SparseArray` of any of the mapped types*
 * `SparseBooleanArray`
 * `ObservableField`
 * `List`, `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` of any of the mapped types*
 * `Map`, `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `SortedMap`, and `TreeMap` of any of the mapped types*
 * `Set`, `HashSet`, `SortedSet`, `TreeSet`, `LinkedHashSet` of any of the mapped types*
 * `Parcelable`
 * `Serializable`
 * Array of any of the mapped types
 * Any other class annotated with `@Parcel`

*Parcel will error if the generic parameter is not mapped.

Parceler also supports any of the above types directly.
This is especially useful when dealing with collections of classes annotated with `@Parcel`:

[source,java]
----
Parcelable listParcelable = Parcels.wrap(new ArrayList<Example>());
Parcelable mapParcelable = Parcels.wrap(new HashMap<String, Example>());
----

==== Polymorphism
Note that Parceler does not unwrap inheritance hierarchies, so any polymorphic fields will be unwrapped as instances of the base class.
This is because Parceler opts for performance rather than checking `.getClass()` for every piece of data.

[source,java]
----
@Parcel
public class Example {
    public Parent p;
    @ParcelConstructor Example(Parent p) { this.p = p; }
}

@Parcel public class Parent {}
@Parcel public class Child extends Parent {}
----

[source,java]
----
Example example = new Example(new Child());
System.out.println(""%b"", example.p instanceof Child); // true
example = Parcels.unwrap(Parcels.wrap(example));
System.out.println(""%b"", example.p instanceof Child); // false
----

Refer to the <<custom-serialization,Custom Serialization>> section for an example of working with polymorphic fields.

=== Serialization techniques

Parceler offers several choices for how to serialize and deserialize an object in addition to the field-based serialization seen above.

==== Getter/setter serialization
Parceler may be configured to serialize using getter and setter methods and a non-empty constructor.
In addition, fields, methods and constructor parameters may be associated using the `@ParcelProperty` annotation.
This supports a number of bean strategies including immutability and traditional getter/setter beans.

To configure default method serialization, simply configure the `@Parcel` annotation with `Serialization.BEAN`:

[source,java]
----
@Parcel(Serialization.BEAN)
public class Example {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private boolean enabled;

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }

    public int getAge() { return age; }
    public void setAge(int age) { this.age = age; }
    
    public boolean isEnabled() { return enabled; }
    public void setEnabled(boolean enabled) { this.enabled = enabled; }
}
----

To use a constructor with serialization, annotate the desired constructor with the `@ParcelConstructor` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Parcel(Serialization.BEAN)
public class Example {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;
    private boolean enabled;

    @ParcelConstructor
    public Example(int age, String name, boolean enabled) {
        this.age = age;
        this.name = name;
        this.enabled = enabled;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }

    public int getAge() { return age; }
    
    public boolean isEnabled() { return enabled; }
}
----

If an empty constructor is present, Parceler will use that constructor unless another constructor is annotated.

==== Mixing getters/setters and fields
You may also mix and match serialization techniques using the `@ParcelProperty` annotation.
In the following example, `firstName` and `lastName` are written to the bean using the constructor while `firstName` is read from the bean using the field and `lastName` is read using the `getLastName()` method.
The parameters `firstName` and `lastName` are coordinated by the parameter names `""first""` and `""last""` respectfully.

[source,java]
----
@Parcel
public class Example {
    @ParcelProperty(""first"")
    String firstName;
    String lastName;

    @ParcelConstructor
    public Example(@ParcelProperty(""first"") String firstName, @ParcelProperty(""last"") String lastName){
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getFirstName() { return firstName; }

    @ParcelProperty(""last"")
    public String getLastName() { return lastName; }
}
----

For attributes that should not be serialized with Parceler, the attribute field, getter or setter may be annotated by `@Transient`.

Parceler supports many different styles centering around the POJO.
This allows `@Parcel` annotated classes to be used with other POJO based libraries, including the following:

 * https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/[GSON]
 * https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/#parceler[Realm]
 * https://bitbucket.org/littlerobots/cupboard[Cupboard]
 * http://simple.sourceforge.net/[Simple XML]
 * https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow[DBFlow]

==== Static Factory support
As an alternative to using a constructor directly, Parceler supports using an annotated Static Factory to build an instance of the given class.
This style supports Google's https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value[AutoValue] annotation processor / code generation library for generating immutable beans.
Parceler interfaces with AutoValue via the `@ParcelFactory` annotation, which maps a static factory method into the annotated `@Parcel` serialization:

[source,java]
----
@AutoValue
@Parcel
public abstract class AutoValueParcel {

    @ParcelProperty(""value"") public abstract String value();

    @ParcelFactory
    public static AutoValueParcel create(String value) {
        return new AutoValue_AutoValueParcel(value);
    }
}
----

AutoValue generates a different class than the annotated `@Parcel`, therefore, you need to specify which class Parceler should build in the `Parcels` utility class:

[source,java]
----
Parcelable wrappedAutoValue = Parcels.wrap(AutoValueParcel.class, AutoValueParcel.create(""example""));
----
And to deserialize:
[source,java]
----
AutoValueParcel autoValueParcel = Parcels.unwrap(wrappedAutoValue);
----

==== Custom serialization
`@Parcel` includes an optional parameter to include a manual serializer `ParcelConverter` for the case where special serialization is necessary.
This provides a still cleaner option for using Parcelable classes than implementing them by hand.

The following code demonstrates using a `ParcelConverter` to unwrap the inheritance hierarchy during deserialization.

[source,java]
----
@Parcel
public class Item {
    @ParcelPropertyConverter(ItemListParcelConverter.class)
    public List<Item> itemList;
}
@Parcel public class SubItem1 extends Item {}
@Parcel public class SubItem2 extends Item {}

public class ItemListParcelConverter implements ParcelConverter<List<Item>> {
    @Override
    public void toParcel(List<Item> input, Parcel parcel) {
        if (input == null) {
            parcel.writeInt(-1);
        }
        else {
            parcel.writeInt(input.size());
            for (Item item : input) {
                parcel.writeParcelable(Parcels.wrap(item), 0);
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public List<Item> fromParcel(Parcel parcel) {
        int size = parcel.readInt();
        if (size < 0) return null;
        List<Item> items = new ArrayList<Item>();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            items.add((Item) Parcels.unwrap(parcel.readParcelable(Item.class.getClassLoader())));
        }
        return items;
    }
}
----

Parceler is also packaged with a series of base classes to make Collection conversion easier located under the `org.parceler.converter` package of the api.
These base classes take care of a variety of difficult or verbose jobs dealing with Collections including null checks and collectin iteration.
For instance, the above `ParcelConverter` could be written using the `ArrayListParcelConverter':

[source,java]
----
public class ItemListParcelConverter extends ArrayListParcelConverter<Item> {
    @Override
    public void itemToParcel(Item item, Parcel parcel) {
        parcel.writeParcelable(Parcels.wrap(item), 0);
    }

    @Override
    public Item itemFromParcel(Parcel parcel) {
        return Parcels.unwrap(parcel.readParcelable(Item.class.getClassLoader()));
    }
}
----

=== Classes without Java source
For classes whose corresponding Java source is not available, one may include the class as a Parcel by using the `@ParcelClass` annotation.
This annotation may be declared anywhere in the compiled source that is convenient.
For instance, one could include the `@ParcelClass` along with the Android Application:

[source,java]
----
@ParcelClass(LibraryParcel.class)
public class AndroidApplication extends Application{
    //...
}
----

Multiple `@ParcelClass` annotations may be declared using the `@ParcelClasses` annotation.

In addition, classes referenced by `@ParcelClass` may be configured using the `@Parcel` annotation.
This allows the serialization configuration through any parameter available on the `@Parcel` annotation including the serialization technique or classes to analyze.

One useful technique is the ability to define global custom converters for a type:
[source,java]
----
@ParcelClass(
    value = LibraryParcel.class,
    annotation = @Parcel(converter = LibraryParcelConverter.class))
class SomeClass{}
----
This allows for fine grained control over a class that isn't available for direct modification.

=== Advanced configuration

==== Skipping analysis
It is a common practice for some libraries to require a bean to extend a base class.
Although it is not the most optimal case, Parceler supports this practice by allowing the configuration of what classes in the inheritance hierarchy to analyze via the analyze parameter:

[source, java]
----
@Parcel(analyze = {One.class, Three.class})
class One extends Two {}
class Two extends Three {}
class Three extends BaseClass {}
----

In this example, only fields of the `One` and `Three` classes will be serialized, avoiding both the `BaseClass` and `Two` class parameters.

==== Specific wrapping

The Parcels utility class looks up the given class for wrapping by class.
For performance reasons this ignores inheritance, both super and base classes.
There are two solutions to this problem.
First, one may specify additional types to associate to the given type via the `implementations` parameter:

[source, java]
----
class ExampleProxy extends Example {}
@Parcel(implementations = {ExampleProxy.class})
class Example {}

ExampleProxy proxy = new ExampleProxy();
Parcels.wrap(proxy);  // ExampleProxy will be serialized as a Example
----

Second, one may also specify the class type when using the `Parcels.wrap()` method:

[source, java]
----
ExampleProxy proxy = new ExampleProxy();
Parcels.wrap(Example.class, proxy);
----

==== Configuring Proguard

To configure Proguard, add the following lines to your proguard configuration file.  These will keep files related to the `Parcels` utilty class and the `Parcelable` `CREATOR` instance:
er
----
# Parceler library
-keep interface org.parceler.Parcel
-keep @org.parceler.Parcel class * { *; }
-keep class **$$Parcelable { *; }
----

#Usage

*For a working implementation, Have a look at the Sample Project - sample*

1. Include the library as local library project.

    ``` compile 'com.yalantis:phoenix:1.2.3' ```

2. Include the PullToRefreshView widget in your layout.

	```xml
    <com.yalantis.phoenix.PullToRefreshView
        android:id=""@+id/pull_to_refresh""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent"">

        <ListView
            android:id=""@+id/list_view""
            android:divider=""@null""
            android:dividerHeight=""0dp""
            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""match_parent"" />

    </com.yalantis.phoenix.PullToRefreshView>
    ```

3. In your `onCreate` method refer to the View and setup OnRefreshListener.
	```java
    mPullToRefreshView = (PullToRefreshView) findViewById(R.id.pull_to_refresh);
    mPullToRefreshView.setOnRefreshListener(new PullToRefreshView.OnRefreshListener() {
        @Override
        public void onRefresh() {
            mPullToRefreshView.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    mPullToRefreshView.setRefreshing(false);
                }
            }, REFRESH_DELAY);
        }
     });
     ```

#Customization

To customize drawables you can change:
   * sun.png - Sun image
   * sky.png - background image
   * buildings.png - foreground image

# Misc
If you need to change progress state:
```java
	mPullToRefreshView.setRefreshing(boolean isRefreshing)
```
#Compatibility
  
  * Android GINGERBREAD 2.3+
  
# Changelog

### Version: 1.2

  * Sample updated with RecyclerView example
  * Showing the refresh view just in it's bounds. (Issue with transparent / empty ListView)
  * Possibility to set refresh view padding

### Version: 1.0

  * Initial Build

## What is Bytecode Viewer?
Bytecode Viewer (BCV) is an Advanced Lightweight Java Bytecode Viewer, GUI Java Decompiler, GUI Bytecode Editor, GUI Smali, GUI Baksmali, GUI APK Editor, GUI Dex Editor, GUI APK Decompiler, GUI DEX Decompiler, GUI Procyon Java Decompiler, GUI Krakatau, GUI CFR Java Decompiler, GUI FernFlower Java Decompiler, GUI DEX2Jar, GUI Jar2DEX, GUI Jar-Jar, Hex Viewer, Code Searcher, Debugger and more.
It's written completely in Java, and it's open sourced. It's currently being maintained and developed by Konloch.

There is also a plugin system that will allow you to interact with the loaded classfiles, for example you can write a String deobfuscator, a malicious code searcher, or something else you can think of.
You can either use one of the pre-written plugins, or write your own. It supports groovy scripting. Once a plugin is activated, it will execute the plugin with a ClassNode ArrayList of every single class loaded in BCV, this allows the user to handle it completely using ASM.

## How do I install BCV?
Download the latest version from https://github.com/konloch/bytecode-viewer/releases and run the Bytecode-Viewer-2.9.x.jar.
You may need to execute it via command line ```java -jar Bytecode-Viewer-2.9.x.jar``` (replace the X with the current minor version)

## How do I use BCV?
All you have to do is add a jar, class or APK file into the workspace. Then select the file you'd like to view from the workspace. BCV will automatically start decompiling the class in the background. When it's done it will show the Source code, Bytecode and Hexcode of the class file you chose (depending on the View panes you have selected). If you are trying to view a resource BCV will attempt to display it the best it can with code highlighting or by embedding the resources itself.

### Welcome to Atmosphere: The Event Driven Framework supporting WebSocket and HTTP

The Atmosphere Framework contains client and server side components for building Asynchronous Web Applications. Atmosphere transparently supports WebSockets, Server Sent Events (SSE), Long-Polling, HTTP Streaming (Forever frame) and JSONP.

The Atmosphere Framework Stack consists of: 

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""http://atmosphere.github.io/atmosphere/images/stack.png""Atmosphere Framework Stack alt=""Atmosphere Stack""/>
</p>

The Atmosphere Framework Stack works on all Servlet based servers, [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and frameworks like [Netty](http://atmosphere.github.io/nettosphere/), [Play! Framework](http://atmosphere.github.io/atmosphere-play/) and [Vert.x](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-vertx). We support a variety of [extensions](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-extensions/tree/extensions-2.4.x) like [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-extensions/tree/master/kafka/modules), [Hazelcast](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-extensions/tree/master/hazelcast/modules), [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-extensions/tree/master/rabbitmq/modules), [Redis](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-extensions/tree/master/redis/modules) and many more.

Atmosphere's Java/Scala/Android Client is called [wAsync](https://github.com/Atmosphere/wasync).

Main development branch is [atmosphere-2.5.x](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/tree/atmosphere-2.5.x) Only pull request for that branch will be accepted.

### News
Our next major revision 4.0 is developped under [Atmosph4rX](https://github.com/Atmosphere/Atmosph4rX). 

### Commercial support
Commercial Support is available via [Async-IO.org](http://async-io.org) 

### To use Atmosphere, add the following dependency:
```xml
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.atmosphere</groupId>
         <artifactId>atmosphere-{atmosphere-module}</artifactId>
         <version>2.4.32 (JDK 8 and lower) | 2.5.4 (JDK 8+)</version>
      </dependency>
```
      
atmosphere-module can be: runtime (main module), jersey, spring, kafka, guice, redis, hazelcast, jms, rabbitmq, jgroups etc. Our official releases are available from Maven Central [download](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|atmosphere).

### Tutorial
Get started using this step by step [tutorial](http://async-io.org/tutorial.html).

### Official Documentation
Easiest way to learn Atmosphere is by trying a [sample](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-samples/). 

Our Wiki contains [several tutorials](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki) for getting started as well as [FAQ](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions). You can also browse the framework's [Javadoc](http://atmosphere.github.com/atmosphere/apidocs/) for Server Components, and [atmosphere.js](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/atmosphere.js-API) for Client Components.

### Quick Start

The Atmosphere Framework ships with many examples describing how to implement WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, Long-Polling, HTTP Streaming and JSONP client applications. Take a look at [this page](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-samples/) to pick the best sample to start with.

#### Jump directly inside the code: WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE), Long-Polling, JSONP and HTTP Streaming!
